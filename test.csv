He used to be a massive threat on 3rd and long but he’s slowed down and his throwing and accuracy have both fallen off because he doesn’t plant his feet and tries to force it with his arm like when he was younger


I’m not saying this to be a dick; I respect Rodgers a lot as an athlete, but he needs to change up his playstyle (more planted form) or he’s going to be replaced or retired in the next two years


You just can’t keep doing what he’s been doing all these years when you’re 36

I work as an employee for the Green Bay Packers football team, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in my racecar bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of scotch and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.

https://imgur.com/a/uO3hUIC

Why The Muskrat? For several reasons. 

1. There are muskrats in Wisconsin. Aaron Rodgers plays for the Green Bay Packers, who are located in Wisconsin.

2. Muskrats look like they have big bushy moustaches. As you can see in the comparison image above, Aaron Rodgers has a big bushy moustache.

3. Muskrats are omniverous. From what I have heard, Aaron Rodgers isn't a vegetarian, thus he is most likely an omnivore. 

4. California's Fish and Game Code allows for the trapping/destruction of Muskrats, since they are considered a nuisance. Aaron Rodgers is currently getting destroyed by a California team.

[Source - Section 4152] (https://www.animallaw.info/statute/ca-hunting-chapter-3-nongame-mammals-and-depredators#4152)

I believe that this is sufficient proof to reclassify Aaron Rodgers' nickname to The Muskrat. Would love to hear opposing debates on the subject."

Do not do what Tom Thompson did and completely ignore the offense for years. Don't draft a WR in the 4th round or later every single year and expect the quarterback to make it work with this group of trash receivers, and do not draft defense in the first two rounds every single year.

The Packers still managed to go 13-3 in spite of the apparent flaws and were trounced by these same 49ers and several weeks later, they're doing it again today.

This game is all but over and a face off with the potent Chiefs will be an intriguing matchup in the Super Bowl."

I just don’t really like  the Packers and Saints cause it’s too offensive and too offensive glorified. I likes hat  the Ninera have done. They have a good style and give credit but I just can’t like them too. I guess Jimmy G is a good guy but I just hate the annoying hype he had two years ago when he did nothing and he seems like that Justin Bieber guy girls obsess over. I just hate the Niners so much and NFC is so boring. I loved the late 2000s and early 2010s NFC. My Giants won the SB but I loved the 2008 Cardinals, 2009 Saints, and the old Seahawks were the best NFC team since the 90s cowboys. I just don’t like the NFC and their teams outside my Giants."
