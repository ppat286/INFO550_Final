J-lo's part was a little more difficult to watch. Her singing felt very flat. Not in terms of key necessarily, but it felt like she had to direct a lot more of her attention to the coreograpghy and singing was more of an afterthought and even her dancing was very stiff. Parts of it felt like you could see her trying to remember which part came next and hesitating. And let's be honest, the songs are just not as good. But I'm not gonna dissect j-lo lyrics unless somebody pays me

Still, it wasn't too bad untill they came on stage together and you could see exactly how much more fluid, or comfortable Shakira felt than j-lo

Mahomes is a generational talent who was always going to win at least one and probably a couple before he hangs them up, so he might as well get his first while we are working our way back to contender status as far as I'm concerned. Hoping we can make this division truly competitive sooner than later but with what the Chiefs have on roster for the next two years or so before all their key pieces sign massive contracts, that's going to be a real challenge. 

Some headscratching coaching moments from Shanny and some poor throws in big moments from Jimmy G were a lot of the difference in this game, and Mahomes was not his usual casually dominant self for long stretches of this one (and didn't deserve MVP over Damien Williams IMO but the league was never gonna pass on a Mahomes Super Bowl MVP), but KC's defense turned it up in the fourth and the Chiefs moved the ball against a great defense that gave them all sorts of problems for most of the middle quarters of the game.

Fun story time: I remember the Pats-Eagles Super Bowl in Feb of '05 (2004 season) That Walrus coached the Eagles. It was right after I had graduated from OSU and I was still living in Columbus, taking a year off to just fuck around and decompress. I remember that winter I walked a few blocks down to my friend's house down 4th ave with a chili cheese queso in my still-warm crockpot. I remember rooting for the Patriots because I fucking hated Terrell Owens. We were drinking Natty light and someone brought wings. I got really stoned and drunk and made out with a girl who lived next door to my friend. We had a table for beer pong and we made a snowman outside at halftime.  

My friend at that house was from my hometown and we worked together at a pizzeria. He didn't make it past December of 2017 because he developed a drinking/pill habit and eventually choked on his own vomit.   

Anyway sorry to get all dark. But that was one of my more memorable Super Bowl memories. He loved his beer and he was always a good dude to have a beer with. I have one every SB in his name. Here's to you, Horse. And congrats to the Chiefs"

But Mahomes just doesn't go away. The guy puts THAT much pressure on your offense to always have to score. And this looked like it might be the first game that Mahomes would lose by more than a score, in fact, by double digits, in his career and instead he wins it by double digits with 21 points in the final 6 minutes.

After he losses any big game he seems to blame everyone else. The 49ers lost this game by thinking a 10 point lead was either insurmountable or that they were the ones down by 10.


It seems the Offense and Defense never reached out to each other and asked the simple question of 'How do we want to proceed for these final seven'? This is where the youth of Shanahan is seen. He absolutely need to tell the defense what his plans are on offense,

It takes a little bit of the edge off knowing there's obviously millions of other people that root for other teams that also invest a ton of emotion into this goddamn game waiting for a payoff in February.

Hopefully we keep it up next year and come back with a 10+ win season. After all, most of us 49er fans probably expected 8-9 wins and we got 15. So close but the future is bright."

No disrespect to the Chiefs, I'm a firm believer that Kansas City sweeping them is a huge fluke and robs the 49ers of truly accomplishing what their capable of. I've spent the last few minutes in pure disbelief and it just doesn't make sense to me. I've spent the entire regular season watching the 49ers play great football it's just not fair.

If the 49ers lose again I will face that the Chiefs deserved the win, but I am just 100% sure it was a fluke and does a big disservice to the 49ers and the NFL.

Then mix it with youth and inexperience and Mahomes was bound to crack a bit. I do think the primary reason for his so so performance were nerves. Add on a strong defense he had to adjust to and it took him 3 quarters to get it together, rally the team and cross the finish line. Ultimately, he showed he has the mental toughness to be a winner and so I am not mad he won the MVP. Stats wise not deserved but overcoming your nerves and mistakes and not letting the team choke in the process makes a compelling story as well."

And Shanahan did it again.  The ball and the lead with 4-5 minutes left, and the two passes just felt like he didn't learn anything from the choke against NE.

3202,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fgeyeno')>,fgeyeno,1,1580743897.0,"It seems to me both teams' passing attacks rely on quite a number of option routes where the receiver adjusts to open space and the quarterback throws the ball to open space.  But does this mean the quarterback takes a split second to verify the receiver actually is breaking in a certain direction, or is the ball thrown like a timing pattern before the break even occurs?

From what I remember Mahomes first interception seemed like a miscommunication with his receiver, so he did throw the ball before the break he expected actually happened from the receiver?

For a classic timing pattern passing attack like Norv Turner's, I suspect the ideal quarterback is your stereotypical taller pocket passer.   If you are asking for an extra fraction of a second to buy time to see the break, I suspect the ideal quarterback has to have excellent wheels and the ability to throw on the run like Mahomes.

These days I think college quarterbacks at the better passing schools are taught to wait for the break to be able to hit the big play.  The wider hashes leave gigantic amounts of open space, one reason I support the NFL adopting college rules like wider hashes."

I can’t even comprehend it, he is one SHELL of a man and what a NUTCASE. And the disrespect and taunting he shows players, you might hate it, but I love and EAT that stuff up.

There were so many blatantly wrong calls going against the 49ers that it cannot be a coincidence. Not one bad call against the Chiefs but 3 very decisive mistakes against SF that could have easily changed the outcome? What are the odds? When even the commentators can’t gloss over the fact that they get fucked by the refs (“that definitely looked like a false start to me”) you just know something’s rigged. That and the fact that Mohomes could do whatever the fuck he wanted. Which includes complaining to the refs and getting a first down he did not make.

Both are fine for mid tier teams. But with an O-Line, a defend, and a running backs as good as they have right now, they need better.

It's embarrassing how bad that performance was in the 4th quarter.

Shanahand fucked the half time clock management to put more points on the board.

He fucked the clock management on the 5 minute game time to get first downs and pressure the chiefs.

I will say there was absolutely some bullshit calls (No holding calls on Mahome runs, That offensive PI on Kittle was BARELY PI at best, and not PI at all compared to the rest of the playoffs), but you can't blame this game on the refs. The L goes entirely to Shanahan and Jimmy G's inability to cope under pressure.

I've been saying it for multiple seasons: Jimmy G is simply not good enough to be a Superbowl QB. You rarely see mediocre QBs getting rings. Most of the time, they're steller teams with a steller QB. Jimmy G is fine. He's even good. But he's just not good enough.

Same Story with Shanahan. He's a fine coordinator. He's a fine coach. He's just not good enough for the rings.

The sad part is - this isn't the patriots of the last 5 years or the packers with steller chances. This is the 49ers with a huge drought and a questionable mix of players, both good and bad. It will likely be years before they get another shot at the trophy. Could be a decade. The L goes to Shanahan."

Not with losing to the Chiefs, I grew up watching mediocrity and I know how it feels to watch a team break a drought. They and Andy Reid deserve it. Not with the Niners, they're still a young team with strong core players. Admittedly I am a bit disappointed with Kyle Shanahan, but that's for another day.

I'm disappointed in you, /r/nfl . 

When the chat bears a closer similarity to /r/nflcirclejerk with the same people who are saying the Chiefs don't have a chance suddenly flip flopping to calling the Niners chokers and crybabies, I can't help but want to close Reddit and just be done with the internet for the evening.

Talk about the most insipid thing you hear in locker rooms.


>What? You wanted me to ask a question? A passive-aggressive command wasn’t enough? Let me try again. What makes sports reporters venture the same cowering, deflated non-question in press conferences across the country? I refer, of course, to the Talk About.

>Talk about the mind-set of this team. Talk about what it means to you to win in the playoffs. “I hear it every single day, and every night, at every game,” said Roy Firestone, who hosted Up Close on ESPN for 13 years. “Somewhere, it’s a Talk About. People should be crazy about this.” True, the Talk About is but one of many reporterly grunts, as Deadspin’s Barry Petchesky has noted. But through its sheer repetition, Talk About has become the quasi-official question of the postgame press conference, and a sign of its crack-up. What “How do you feel?” is to the crime beat, Talk About is to sportswriting."

When Mahomes ran for the first down, in the first half, he fumbled. IMO it was a huge play that needed expert clarification. I wanted to know the rules before the Refs came to a decision. Instead they went to break and explained it after. 
Had it happened in the fourth qtr there's no way they would have cut to a break. We need Mike Pereira immediately. It's the only way to keep integrity in the game. But instead they went for the money bc that's what's important to them. Ultimately they made they right call, but leaving us in limbo was bullshit. And tbh, I knew the call, but I still wanted it confirmed before the Refs made it official. 
In hindsight nothing changed and the play wasn't significant, but it could have been."

Giving up at half with 1:30 and 3 timeouts. Passing the ball with 9 mins left on second down when the most successful aspect of the offense has been outside running. I mean, this isn't hindsight is 20/20 shit, this is stuff any basic football coach should know not to do. I really don't want Kyle calling plays for us, he's a good coach, but he's clearly proven he can't handle the SB, he must get so nervous or he much over think things too much.

Wherever the ball carrier is tackled, or goes out of bounds from, the line of scrimmage is now set at. Think of each ""down"" as the number of tries the offense has to move the ball forwards by 10 yards. The offense has 4 tries to go 10 yards, or 4 ""downs"". The 10 yards is essentially a line on the field, and is the offense's objective on the way to the endzone. So, 1st down means its their 1st of the 4 tries. 2nd down, is the second attempt, and so on. If the team does move the ball by 10 yards, the ""downs"" reset back to 1st down and the objective line is moved 10 yards further down. If on 1st down, they move 6 yards forward, the following play would be 2nd down and 4 to go. Or, 2nd and 4. Sometimes the objective will be 15 yards due to a penalty, or if the ball carrier is tackled behind the line of scrimmage and lose yards. If the offense fails to meet their objective (typically 10 yards from the line of scrimmage) they must turn the ball over to the other time at that spot. On the 4th down, it is often more likely to benefit the team on offense to punt the ball down the field, in order to make the other team have a longer distance to travel to their endzone. 

Dude, I'm realizing that im doing a terrible job explaining this and am going to stop before i just confuse you more. Hope this helped a little bit. The best way to learn is just watching it and have someone explain as you go. Or better yet, play Madden. Hope the weather is nice in Sweden!"

But he had some fantastic rushing and key passes to keep them in the game and then, most importantly when they were behind he delivered when it mattered. 

The fact that he didn’t lose his cool and got the job done is all you can ask of a QB in games like this."

He withstood immense pressure from the Niners the entire game and his freakin receivers kept backpedaling on automatic 1st downs forcing extra downs. I've never seen so many 9-yard completions that should have been for 10 yards or more. Kelce actually STOPPED short of the 1st down marker on purpose. I was like where are these guys heads at? And Mahomes avoided so many sacks and had several big runs that kept the chains moving and limiting the Niners opportunities. This was the hardest game of his career to overcome and he came up huge in the 4th.

The 49ers pass rush led by Bosa was just getting to Mahomes too fast.  The Chiefs had to wait it out until the 49ers D was just a little gassed to give Mahomes an extra split second to make passes.

At one point in the second half, I think the Chiefs were experimenting with hammering Bosa with two blockers, but that was compromising the rest of the pass blocking.  

Finally the Chiefs sensed their moment and were able to revert back to their preferred and usual offensive scheme."

I was super depressed after the 2012 loss though.  That one definitely took a long time to get over.

SF had already called one timeout (remember, Williams’ run was on second down), and would have had to call their second to stop the clock there. 

So: if Williams had kneeled instead of scoring, KC would have had a first down with ~1:10 left and the 49ers with one timeout.

Math. 

First down kneel: 49ers call final timeout. Clock is at ~1:05. 

Second down kneel: 49ers have no timeouts, clock runs down to ~0:25. 

Third down kneel: game clock runs out. 

The Chiefs would have been able to kneel the clock out and the Niners would never have touched it again."

I had no dog in this fight (not really a fan or sworn enemy of either the Niners or the Chiefs) but it is frustrating to watch a team collapse because of bad game management. I like Reid-he’s a legitimately great coach and he had a great team but he also got a little lucky in going up against Shanahan. Not that that’s the only reason he’s won, but we’ve seen Reid pull defeat from the jaws of victory with shit clock management in the past. There’s definitely a mental game on the coaching end that requires keeping your head. Especially the last two minutes during which a lot of people can’t manage to keep it together (including very famously Reid in the past). Shanahan lost that game and the overall game because of it."

Damien Williams getting the TD gave you guys a shot to get a TD, 2 point conversion and onside kick. Unlikely, but likelier to win in that scenario than in my proposed sequence."

His QB rating dropped with the Fuller INT, which obviously doesn't happen in a Niner-win scenario. He was like 17/19 with a TD before his awful 4th... But again in a Niner-win scenario his 4th quarter numbers obviously look better.

I'm not entirely sold on Jimmy as the future, but unless someone clearly better lands in our lap we would be stupid to intentionally get rid of him for someone else like a draft pick or FA.

Especially when you gain 5 yards on the first run, so you have some breathing room in case you do lose two or three yards. 

Yes, the defense will be expecting it, but in that situation they aren’t going to send an all out blitz. So the odds of finding a receiver open enough to not risk throwing an interception is lower than I’d like to accept.

But I do agree that I suppose it's difficult to point to a single player that deserves it more. Quarterbacks have a very high floor of value even if they don't perform so well just because they effectively touch the ball every offensive play. And as far as his offense goes everyone played well but there wasn't necessarily one dude popping off the charts. So maybe my initial take is wrong and Mahomes deserves it, but I really can't concede that he played a good game. I thought he threw late and innacurately consistently to wide open receivers with most of the pressure in his face being self inflicted due to slow reads and poor dropbacks. Aside from 1 or 2 dimes to essentially wide open receivers and an average running performance (for him I mean, so above actual average) he just didn't do anything that impressed me, while the offense overall was spectacular"

So sure if he made the plays and won the game give him it. But that’s not what happened, lol. He coughed up two ints and had a <70 passer rating so all of this is all moot.

We don't really want them stopping the game after every play, to review all the possible holding/etc penalties that may have occurred on every single play.

Just so ""fan of losing team"" doesn't complain that 1 missed call ""turned the tides"", and his favorite team just wasn't able to drum up the courage/will to overcome the insurmountable momentum that it created.

After Dick Vermeil left and his father died, for years KC was seen as a dead end job like the Browns or Bengals are today. Clark personally turned that around.

It's no different than being loyal to a boss that treated you well and made you successful, or a writer sharing credit with his English teacher, something like that. He cares, and he poured his effort and his resources into making the team successful. It's not nothing."

Literally two extra running plays would have bled more time off the clock than the Patriots needed. They tied the game with under a minute left on the clock on a 10 play, 91 yard drive. The Falcons defense was completely gassed at the end. Running the ball gives them more time to rest, and leaves the Patriots less time to score. The Falcons ran pass play after pass play. Literally  just run the ball and you win, even with a 3 and out on every possession.    

Both sides of the ball have to succeed, but the Falcons offense was not pulling their weight at all, which caused the defense to wear down because they were on the field almost the entire 4th quarter."

But there's players on the field who have to execute the plays and a defense that also needs to make stops. Football is the ultimate team sport and everyone familiar with the sport recognizes that.

If we're going to be memed for this, so be it. I'm still extremely happy we went from picking 2nd in the draft to the super bowl in one year. This was an awesome season for us that subverted everyone's expectations and I see literally nothing to be upset about.

Harbaugh: 60%+ win rate, 8 playoffs, 4 division titles, 3 AFC championship appearances, 1 Superbowl win 

Riverboat Ron: average win rate (54-55%), 4 playoff appearances, 1 NFC championship, 1 Superbowl appearance

Doug Pederson despite a young coaching career: 59% win rate, 3 playoffs in 4 years, 4-2  so far in the playoffs, 2 division titles, Philly's only Superbowl win in their storied franchise.

Your argument that because Marty isn't in, Andy isn't a lock is irrelevant because Andy is better than Marty.

Over the same number of seasons Andy has:

Higher win rate

More playoff appearances

More division titles

MUCH more success in the playoffs (if Andy lost yesterday his playoff record would be 14-15, Marty's was an atrocious 5-13 and that is what has kept him out of the HOF)

More championship appearances

More Superbowl appearances

So seeing as Andy is better across the board than Marty, who is a borderline HOFer who might still make it in someday, yes I'd say Andy was a lock regardless of yesterday's game.

As for your last comment, challenge accepted.

Jimmy Johnson. The only thing he has over Reid is 2 Superbowl wins on a stacked cowboys team. Didn't even crack 100 wins, and the most memorable name on his coaching tree is Norv Turner.

Marv Levy can be argued. Less wins than Andy, worse win rate than Andy, got to four straight Superbowls in a weak AFC and was slaughtered in all but one of them. He does have a better coaching tree with Bill Walsh and Wade Phillips, but I think Andy still has the stronger resume and Andy still has coaches out that that can build on his legacy.

Sid Gillman got in almost entirely because of his coaching tree and not his actual ability as a coach. Not that he was a bad coach, but Reid's credentials are much better.

Several player/coaches got in more as a combination of their play and coaching. An argument could be made that Andy has a better resume than these guys as well since his career as a coach stands on its own. Guys like Ditka, Shell, and Flores."

He played a great game, I just don't think he should get *extra* points for not having it all together at the beginning of the game is what I'm getting at."

Me yelling at TV: Of course you do jack ass!

Me: oh you gotta be fucking kidding me Rob

He didn’t guess a singer at the end of the song though, so I let it slide. Obviously they don’t want to give away who it is on the first episode if he’s not getting eliminated. 

But then they get to the end and he guesses Shaun White. All of the sudden I started to question my reality. Was this not Lil Wayne? How would Rob not have instantly recognized his voice. 

Then after they do the reveal he had the audacity to act all surprised.

Rob: This is the most shocked I have ever been on this show!

Me yelling at TV again: There is no way you didn’t know that was him. There is just absolutely no fucking way you didn’t know it was him!

It was then that I realized I was screaming at the TV over the Masked Singer. At that point all that was left were questions. How did I get here? How did I become so invested in this? Is it really that big of a deal if the show is a little staged? Is it possible he actually didn’t know it was Wayne? Which would even be worse? So many questions with so few answers...

All questionable calls went to the Chiefs and they got away with more holds.  There was a bad ball spot that gave them a 1st down before the big throw to Hill as well.  The delay of game that wasn't called against the 49ers was not only irrelevent at that point but was basically the only point where the refereeing went in their favour.  Before that play was a blatant neutral zone infraction that wasn't called on the Chiefs.  Replay not even shown on TV.  Croatian commentators were dumbfounded how it wasn't called.
