No disrespect to the Chiefs, I'm a firm believer that Kansas City holding Derrick Henry to under 100 yards is a huge fluke and robs the Titans of truly accomplishing what their capable of. I've spent the last few minutes in pure disbelief and it just doesn't make sense to me. I've spent the entire regular season watching Derrick Henry run over defenses it's just not fair.

If the Titans lose again I will face that the Chiefs deserved the win, but I am just 100% sure it was a fluke and does a big disservice to the Titans and the NFL.

All that said, imo the league needs to take a look at the PI rule for underthrown balls again. It's so frustrating watching the receiver stop to ""catch"" an underthrown ball and draw PI. The receiver has the right to run their route, but I personally feel that the defender in that case has the same right to continue his. I'd like to see that removed personally. Because even when the defender starts to turn their head around, they still get called for it a lot and you know you would lose that PI challenge. It's stupid that teams are routinely bailed out for poorly thrown passes thanks to this rule.

Superbowl is more of a one-off knockout game where it's highly possible that you just have a bad day amidst all the distractions associated with the grandeur of the event. It doesn't reflect real football.

A conference win is the ultimate culmination of your team having a good season and reflects on your achievements of the season better than winning a Superbowl.

Once you win the conference, whatever happens in the Superbowl should make zero difference to how you are perceived as a football team and how your season is analyzed."

Plus, Mahomes immediately wowed in OTAs, training camp, and the preseason and the reports about him in practices were glowing from the start.

By the end of the 2017 season, I'd say probably 80-90% of KC fans supported  trading Smith and starting Mahomes - especially considering the fact that Smith's cap hit was due to go way up in 2018.

To bench a Heisman-winning starting QB drafted #2 overall and winner of a recent Wild Card game in favor of a veteran QB who hadn't been playing at a starter level for a few seasons is already rare. But to suddenly have that veteran become one of the best QBs in the league and unlock so much hidden offensive talent this team had for years, that's just unheard of. 

I'll admit I had no clue who Jonnu Smith, Anthony Firkser, Mycole Pruitt, Kalif Raymond, or Brett Kern were until this Tannehill-led run. That's my fault because these were all great role players that proved they could contribute significantly when put in position to. But it's wild to think they could all be overlooked until Tannehill actually spread the ball around.

I really hope Tannehill can become their franchise QB and be a consistent leader for this team. He hits the right blend of smart, tough, and athletic to compete with almost any current or upcoming QB. He might not have done a lot in the playoff stats, but he still played extremely well in my mind and his upside looks incredible."

However against a team who is so explosive like the chiefs they don't need a lot of time to go up the field and score.  The titans defense was playing really well but you are going to get scored  on by KC  it is inevitable. So once KC scored multiple times and took the lead what were titans to do? You can some of the time to keep the defense guessing but you need to rely on your qb to get you out of the hole. Ryan T didn't do that.  I mean the fact that Ryan T only had like 12 completed passes the past two games means the game was taken out his hands."

No, but if you build your team around that expectation instead of building a real defense you're asking a lot to go right. 

I like Reid, but his clock management and poor D has cost us a ton.  Guys not making plays and spells of abhorrent tackling.  I've been to a ton of chiefs games, worked a bunch of them, and will be rooting for them in the superbowl, but damn we've got serious problems in D that we've let slide for several years while we blamed Alex Smith.

Refer to Chiefs vs Chargers 2016 week 1. Given it wasn't a big playoff game like it was versus Houston, but it certainly shows that Alex had it in him, and that was even before Alex's best season in 2017-2018. 

And if you compare Alex's numbers when they lost to the Titans in 2018 vs Mahomes' numbers in this game, they're quite comparable with a one touchdown difference. Now of course, that's a significant difference there, but let's not pretend like Alex was somehow just neutral at best in terms of impact on the team's performance. 

I love Alex, I also love Mahomes. Alex ain't no Mahomes, but he's certainly not a mediocre QB that so many unappreciative chiefs fans make him out to be."

Obviously at the end of the day there's millions of fans and they're going to support their team cause hurr durr football!  People need to be able to separate themselves from their team and the game.  People wear it as part of their identity and take personal offense when it's attacked.

I think it was very apparent to most of us living and dying with the team every week that there was room for the offense to improve, just not with Alex Smith under center. It's so much harder to win in the playoffs with a good but not quite great QB when you're consistently playing other teams with great QBs.

The other side is it's the same ex causing issues now that accused him of that. Then when she was secretly recording him trying coach him into admitting guilt to both events. He didn't, and she wouldn't even admit he hit her or anything in 2014. He was trying to fight the charges, but he ran out of money. New lawyer said to just take the plea deal since he couldn't afford to fight it. Oklahoma State didn't want to deal with the PR nightmare of keeping him on the team once charges showed up on his record after taking the plea deal. And the first incident that he was accused of last offseason took place in his home when he was out of town. But I'm sure he used his super speed to run home, smack his kid around and run back to wherever he was actually at before anyone noticed. 

It doesn't take much mental gymnastics to defend someone until they're proven guilty. It just takes setting aside preconceived biases and waiting for any definitive proof to come (if it ever does).

He is open and honest about his anger management issues. So he may have harmed his ex or kid, but there has never been any proof of either, and not every person with anger management issues is a physically abusive asshole.

If you take a QB prospect you believe in and miss, so be it. Try again. Sometimes you get a  Leaf but sometimes you get a Brees or a Rivers. Admittedly teams like the Browns take that strategy too far. But so did the Chiefs (in the other direction) when they missed on Todd Blackledge and then immediately decided to settle for 30 years of safe QB mediocrity.

And yeah, it’s for sure the way he responds to throws he knows he could have made better that makes him such a legend even this early in his career. The 60-yard TD pass that went 50+ in the air, and he wasn’t even throwing off a solid base, epitomizes the ridiculous nature of watching Mahomes play.  I genuinely feel like every time he uncorks a deep ball I’m going to see a touchdown no matter where they’re at on the field, lol. 

And he and Kelce have been on another level this postseason, as far as their chemistry goes. Kelce has been unreal at getting himself open and Mahomes has hit him on the money - even when the throw / move to get free didn’t really make sense - nearly every time.
