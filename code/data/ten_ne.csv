27,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd71a6a')>,fd71a6a,8175,1578227023.0,"The Titans special teams wasting 1:45 off the clock without running a play is absolutely genius, 200 IQ coaching, and very well could have been the difference in the game.

10/10, very well done.

EDIT (for those asking how it was done):

Basically the Titans were punting from the Pats 40. They chose to run the clock to get a delay of game, but because the game clock was outside 5 minutes, it continued to run after the penalty was accepted. Then, because you would get an unsportsmanlike penalty after back to back delay of games, they intentionally false started right before the play clock hit 0 the second time. The third time, the Patriots entered the neutral zone, but they were going to run the clock down again.

Here's the sequence (thanks /u/JD42305) https://youtu.be/CTsvc9pkZ04

EDIT 2: There are a lot of people asking why BB didn't just decline the penalties. That wouldn't have fixed the running game clock, it only would have changed what yardline the ball was at for the punt. The Pats could have called a timeout at any point during the fiasco to stop the clock, but at that point, there were 5 minutes left in a 1 point game. The whole thing could just have easily benefited the Patriots instead of the Titans. It just happens that with how the Titans D showed up at the end, it ended up helping them more."

The coaches were so clearly the main story of the game - like watching a chess match where the whole point is to understand the strategy and intent instead of focusing on the pieces.

Like using Henry as the primary weapon to control the clock and the Patriots trying to prevent any form of play action passing. Or the end of the 2nd half where James White failed to get a first down, forcing the Patriots into a Hail Mary and the Titans literally sending all 11 defenders into coverage (which was weirdly terrifying to watch no one pass rush a hall of fame QB). Or the beginning of the 3rd quarter where Romo illustrated the 6-1 ""Super Bowl defense"" the Patriots began using to try and shut down Henry and the offense. Or the wild penalties and punt situation on that late 4th down in the final quarter. Or literally all of Kern's punts and the Titans' spectacular special teams play. Even small moments like the Titans purposely lining up quickly to avoid the Patriots subbing out their personnel, the Titans intentionally playing soft pass rush to better defend the screen game and James White, etc. You could tell these two teams are extremely well coached and both staff groups were ready for a chess match. 

Romo being on this was so helpful to illustrate just how critical strategy can be in a game like this one. I'd probably be bored out of my mind watching this game in the stadium or at a bar, but Romo and Nantz made it a really engaging watch. Absolutely fascinating to see how well this Titans team does going forward."

My opinion of Tom Brady's actual skills a QB aside (relies so heavily on checkdowns and easy passes), he hasn't had weapons and support around him on the offense this year beyond Edelman. Imagine if the Pats had even someone like Golden Tate, could make such a big difference on that offense. Same with the run game, Sony Michel was just not as productive as he should've been this season. If the pats had a half decent run game and more than one legitimate receiver they would've looked a lot different. That being said, hell of a game for the Titans, Henry is a beast, excited for them vs the Ravens!"

The answer was to employ an immovable defensive tackle to clog up two gaps on running plays. That is how the Colts were a major part in handing the Patriots a couple more Super Bowl wins by letting Malcolm Brown slip through to where the Patriots could draft him very late first round. And before him there was the fantastic Vince Wilfork.

The Patriots heavies were so good stuffing the run inside when it mattered that it scared off Pete Carroll at the most crucial moment in a Super Bowl from running the football to Marshawn Lynch.

But this was the year the Titans brought to the game a freight train Derrick Henry that could find the hole in an outside zone run. In theory the Patriots had traded for yet another heavy defensive tackle, Shelton, to be that immovable object clogging up the middle. But the Titans had the personnel to finally beat that defense. Plus their defense stepped up big time."

It's not a story the league would tell you. It's a Patriot Legend. Darth Belichick was a dark Coach of the Patriots, so powerful and so wise, he could use the rulebook to influence the playbook to create loopholes. He could even keep the team he cared about from losing. The Dark Side of the rulebook is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful...the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, and then his apprentice beat him in a Wild Card Game. Ironic. He could save others from losing, but not himself."

846,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd7awog')>,fd7awog,18,1578230535.0,SYSTEM QB.
847,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd71a98')>,fd71a98,105,1578227023.0,"This is appropriate following the pats loss:

In Brady‚Äôs last 19 seasons he has a winning percentage of .779. The average winning percentage for all 32 franchise is .50025. If we adjust his winning percentage down to compensate for the outlier to a generous .532 (Still above league average) than he‚Äôll average a much more reasonable 8.512 wins per season instead of 12.464 wins per season 

The next outlier is career length. Tom Brady is entering his 20th year as an nfl quarterback. The average career length for a quarterback is three years. This is an extremely flukey stat. Let‚Äôs adjust his career to a more reasonable 13 years instead of 20. That still gives him a longer career length than titans of the game like Kyle Orton

Brady‚Äôs stats are also riddled with statistical outliers. 

Lets start with attempts. The league average in pass attempts over Tom Brady‚Äôs career is 471.05. Let‚Äôs be generous and adjust this to 485 for Brady per season 

Next we‚Äôll do completions. The league average for completions across Brady‚Äôs career is 286. Again we‚Äôll help him out and give 306. That‚Äôs pretty above average. That‚Äôll give him an average completion percentage of 63.09% across a season

TD percentage is next. The average TD % across Brady‚Äôs career is 4.27%. We‚Äôll give him a 4.4 TD%. That‚Äôd have him average 21.34 TDs per season. Much more reasonable 

Now we‚Äôre gonna adjust his Int %. The average across his career is 2.76. We‚Äôll compensate for that by putting his at 2.25. So he‚Äôd average 10.9 Ints per season.

We‚Äôll finish with Y/A. The average across Brady‚Äôs career is 7.04. Let‚Äôs be generous and give him an average of 7.56 yards per attempt. This means he‚Äôd average 3668 yards per season.

So let‚Äôs look at his season average all together. When adjusted for outliers, Tom Brady‚Äôs average season looks like this: 306/485 3668 yards 21 TDs 11 Ints a 63% completion percentage and a 91.16 passer rating.

Extrapolate that based on his adjusted career length and Tom Brady ends up with 47686 yards, 111 wins 273 TDs and 143 Ints instead of his gaudy, and flukey 215 wins, 531 TDs and 73000 yards

Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt correctly adjust his career. Well even over his 19 year (omitting year 20 because it isn‚Äôt complete yet) with the correctly adjusted stats he‚Äôd have 161 wins, 399 TDs and 69696 (nice) career yards.

Lastly, During Tom Brady‚Äôs career 19 Super Bowls have been played. He‚Äôs won 6 of them which is extremely flukey. The ideal average amount of super bowl wins for each franchise is .594 Super Bowls per team. With that in mind, we‚Äôll be nice to Brady and round that way above average to 1

So what does this tell us?

Simply put, when you adjust Brady‚Äôs stats to by removing the outlier numbers then he has roughly the career numbers and per season averages of Carson Palmer. The ‚ÄúGOAT‚Äù qb‚Äôs career is heavily inflated by flukeyness and his stats and accomplishments should be taken with a grain of salt."

The O line isn‚Äôt what it needs to be for a player like Brady. 

The Titans ran the ball down their throats. Tannehill is looking like their franchise QB. Henry been a top 5 back for a couple of years now and he finally gets the stage to showcase his skills. They have good not great defense. They can give the Ravens some trouble. 

The Pats can easily retool their team and be back in the playoff hunt next year. I know sports media is gonna be all over the Pats until training camp but something tells me this isn‚Äôt over for the Brady/Bellichick era. 

The Titans are a few pieces away from being a title contender.

&nbsp;

**Verse 1, shortened:**

‚ô´ When a humble team

Graced a ride along

With Derrick of Henry

Along came this song ‚ô´ 

&nbsp;
    
‚ô´ From when El Tractorcito fought

A silver-tongued‚ÄÖHoodie

His army of elves

At his hooves‚ÄÖdid they revel ‚ô´

&nbsp;


**[Chorus]**

‚ô´ Toss a coin to the Titans

O' Valley of Plenty

O' Valley of Plenty, oh

Toss a coin to the Titans

O' Valley of Plenty ‚ô´

&nbsp;

**Verse 2:**

‚ô´ At the site of Gillette

Fight the mighty Pats

That bashes and breaks you

And brings you to mourn ‚ô´

&nbsp;

‚ô´ They thrust every TB12

Far back on the shelf

High up on the mountain

From whence it came ‚ô´

&nbsp;

‚ô´ They wiped out our pest

Got kicked in their chests

They're a friend of humanity

So give them the rest ‚ô´

&nbsp;

‚ô´ That‚Äôs my epic tale:

A champion prevailed

Defeated the Hoodie

Now pour them some ale ‚ô´

&nbsp;

**[Chorus]**

‚ô´ Toss a coin to the Titans

O' Valley of Plenty

O' Valley of Plenty, oh

Toss a coin to the Titans

O' Valley of Plenty ‚ô´

O' Valley of Plenty, oh

Toss a coin to the Titans

Brady has proven he can still throw the ball well as a starter, he just needs more people he can actually throw to. Edelman‚Äôs drop in that second-to-last drive was the real killer of this game, not the pick 6, which was a rebound anyways, hard to really pin it on Brady.

Seriously shut the fuck up about that.  It's as if these guys have never seen a free agent resign with the same team.  Brady has done well with Boston, Boston has done well with Brady, if he wants to suit up, there's no chance this team doesn't let him ride again. 

They even said at the end ""I can't believe we're not talking about the titans."" seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you both? 

Why was that the story line of the whole game?  You have the head coach of the other team being a player under Belichick and Brady, why not talk about that?  Why not talk about this ""historically good defense""?  (Spoiler, The Patriots defense really didn't go up against a strong run game except the chiefs, and Ravens, both loses).  Why not talk about the Titans doing great.  Talk about Tannenhill's redemption from the toilet bowl that is Miami?  (They mention that once and quickly move back to Brady).  Seriously.  

What a lousy fucking job they did announcing.  The thing is I like Romo, and he's been consistent but this game they just seemed to want to talk about Brady leaving and couldn't figure out why he didn't talk about that? (Because he was focused on this game guys?)"

Blowhard Bill Belichick has forever lost all right to preach of blocking out distractions, considering he himself thought it a brilliant fucking idea to bring in THE LITERAL PERSONIFICATION OF THE CONCEPT OF DISTRACTIONS!!! You would think a galaxy-brained individual such as Belichick would know that Gronk just retired, Watson was suspended four games, and receivers are a premium, especially considering the risk involved in bringing in Brown. Nope! Trade Demariyus Thomas to the Jets, of all teams! And by the way, it‚Äôs never a good idea to repeat the stunts that caused a scandal the first time around! ‚ÄúbUt I‚Äôm BiLl BeLiChIcK!‚Äù Fuck off with that shit!

Do you want to know the moment I knew the fuckwit in the hoodie had irreversibly screwed this team over for good?! I knew it plain as day when I read that we had signed Cody Kessler! CODY FUCKING KESSLER!!! We were SO STRAPPED FOR CAP THAT WE HAD TO FILL A ROSTER SPOT ON BRINGING IN A FORMER CLEVELAND BROWNS QUARTERBACK TO BE OUR THIRD STRINGER UNTIL WATSON‚ÄôS SUSPENSION WAS OVER!!! That was about $15 million in cap space that was doomed to go to waste, and somehow, THE ALLEGED GOAT OF NFL HEAD COACHES WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO THOUGHT HE‚ÄôD LAST THE WHOLE SEASON!!! You can‚Äôt POSSIBLY convince me that was money better spent on trading for Emmanuel Sanders! I mean, Edelman, Sanders, AND Sanu all catching passes from Tom Brady?!?!? This is all grounds for immediate firing for any other coach - in fact, I‚Äôd just be happy with him losing GM powers going forward, but even THAT kind of accountability is a mere pipe dream! But I don‚Äôt want him gone JUST yet. First, I want to see him without a winning season in the Jarrett Stidham era, and thus finally exposing him for the arrogant fraud he truly is - it‚Äôs no coincidence he‚Äôs had zero winning seasons before happening on Tom Brady. Hell, I don‚Äôt even think he cracked .500 with Super Bowl quarterback and #1 overall pick Drew Bledsoe! I want to see the pundits asking themselves, ‚ÄúWere we wrong about Bill Belichick the whole time?‚Äù ‚ÄúHas Brady ALWAYS carried Belichick?‚Äù ‚ÄúWas Bill Belichick NOT the GOAT?‚Äù And in my heart of hearts, I will know that the answer, now and forever, has been ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù"

4655,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd7b428')>,fd7b428,54,1578230614.0,They should probably fix it by allowing the team who didn't commit the foul to choose whether the clock should be running or stopped after the penalty is announced.

As some point you have to look at an offense with Marshall Trashhouse  at LT, two rookies including a UDFA at wideout, easily the worst TE Corp in the league and a middle linebacker at Fullback and say ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs not a healthy team, nor a good team.‚Äù   IMO the Pats overachieved this year largely due to the foundation of early season wins before it all fell apart.

Tannehill managed the game well enough to win, obviously Henry is a freak and did his thing, their punter kicked the game of his life, and even their defense did a nice job taking away the Patriots' weapons.  I've got nothing but respect for Vrabel and the entire team, they made us look foolish for much of it.

The Titans got multiple penalties on 4th down (when they were at mid field and punting anyways) to run about a minute and a half off the clock. Another smart thing they did was planning on going delay of game, false start, and delay of game on three consecutive plays because three straight delay of games adds another 15 yards but the Pats got an offsides on one of the plays."
6682,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd78lz9')>,fd78lz9,108,1578229653.0,"The Titans were going to punt but there was about 6:45 left on the clock and they were winning. It really doeant matter where the punter kicks from when the offense is between their opponents 40 and their own 40, so they could care less about 5yd delay of game penalties. The clock continuea to run when the offense commits a penalty because the NFL rulebook assumes this hurts the offense. In this case, the Bill's wanted to take time off the clock so that the Patriots had less clock to play with. Vrabel felt that taking off 1:45 or so from the clock would benefit his team, so they continued to kill the clock up to the 5 minute mark, where the clock stops running immediately and now only starts when the ball is snapped."
6683,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd78mm8')>,fd78mm8,12,1578229660.0,The clock continues to run down after penalties so the titans took a delay of game and a false start penalty to kill the clock

*And I should add that you can't take 2 of the same penalties in a row here. Hence the delay of game, false start, then subsequent neutral zone infraction (would've been another delay of game if not the infraction)."

>""The wind can blow hard off of Lake Erie. It blows easterly, swooping over the left rim of Buffalo's Ralph Wilson Stadium, down to the field and then back up over the luxury suites on the right. It can swirl and have a modest impact on the outcome of a football game. You can't control the wind, but you can use it to your advantage -- make it an opportunity.""  
""I was the special teams coach for the Buffalo Bills in the early 1980s. In our pregame warm-up, as we prepared to play the New England Patriots, the wind was blowing hard. I figured we could create a wind tunnel if we opened the east-side tunnel door of the stadium when New England was kicking against the wind. I worked with our equipment managers and told them, on my signal, to open the doors.

 Noisegate (2015)

In their September 20, 2015 home game against the defending Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots, the Buffalo Bills illegally used artificial stadium noise to attempt (unsuccessfully) to slow down the Patriots offense.

According to the [NFL rules on crowd noise](http://old.seattletimes.com/html/seahawks/2003266386_hawkchart20web.html): ""Noise of any kind (music, horns, gongs, drums, etc.) that is under club control **must cease when the play clock (40 or 25 second) is running** and the visiting team is in possession of the ball.""

&#x200B;

 Injurygate (2012)

The NFL [fined the Buffalo Bills](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000082416/article/nfl-fines-buffalo-bills-washington-redskins-over-injuries) $20,000 for violating the NFL's procedures for reporting injury information.

The Bills failed to list defensive end Mario Williams on the injury report while being treated for a sprained wrist. Williams commented publicly on October 3 prior to Week 5 games about how the wrist had been bothering him and limiting his effectiveness. Although Williams fully participated in practices and games after sustaining the injury, he should have been listed on the report with a wrist injury and fully participating in practice. Williams has been listed on the Bills' injury report with a wrist injury the past two weeks."

i was criticizing his play all season. he simply was not good this year. let him keep playin lmao

everytime i said anything about his play this season, ppl on here told me ‚ÄúNO HES GONNA WIN THE SUPER BOWL LIKE ALWAYS, THIS IS NORMAL!‚Äù

like just try watching him play. the defense carried this team.

it‚Äôs fitting for his season to end in a game where the defense allowed zero points in the second half and brady just needed to lead the offense to a FIELD GOAL. and nope"

Belichick needs to be completely scrutinized for how he fucked this game up. And Tom Brady is a shit quarterback for that pick six, he has no field vision and he's playing like he's a 50 year old man. First the Red Sox not making the playoffs then the Pats self combusting.

A lot of people point to the Lamar Jackson and say that's why the Ravens are so good. But a huge factor of the offensive success has been personnel groupings like having two or three TEs on the field at once or two RBs on the field with only a single WR, etc.

There's a lot of strategy going into that Baltimore offense, and if Vrabel and his coaches maintain this kind of situational strategizing then I'm excited to see what gameplan they cook up to try and stop them. I really do think the Ravens can be stopped on offense, but we'll see who can figure them out aside from last year's Chargers."

However, I really dont wanna shit on Tannehill too bad. He made key throws when he needed to.

Sanu has not really shown up, and our best reciever is Edelman who has been our ""escape valve"" up to this point?   Brady threw well, and the O-line didn't give him time when he was sacked.

Suddenly the lights go out and gray stormy clouds descend upon the stadium.  In a low wretched voice from the sky Bill Belichick bellows out ""did you really think it would be that easy?!""  Lightning rips across the sky, illuminating the entrance tunnel revealing the mechanized New England Patriots.  Tom Brady approaches midfield with a robotic gait, towering over Lamar Jackson.  A steady static plays from his voice box as he hacks the stadium speakers.  ""I am inevitable,"" as more lighting tears through the clouds.  It reverberates across a 300 mile radius and shatters every window.  Lamar Jackson looks Tom in the eyes and says ""I eat butt munches like you for breakfast.""  Lamar puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles.  The crowd rushes the field like the Battle of Stirling bridge.  Eli Manning leads the forces with Ryan Fitzpatrick by his side.  The battle ensues for hours as corpses pile on top of one another.  From the press box Jerry Jones is eating a twix.  The humans become surrounded and badly wounded; pressed into their own endzone with the goal posts shadowing over.  ""What do we do now?!"" Shouts Tony Siragusa.  An angelic figure from the rear proceeds to the front.  Drew Bledsoe stands in front of the demoralized players.  ""I was there when he was made."" As he turns to downfield.  ""Wha... what are you doing?"" Asks Brian Hoyer.  With a thousand yard stare peering downfield Bledsoe says ""what I should have done a long time ago.""  He pulls out a high volume ball pump with a three foot needle.  He charges the field with an echoing war cry.  The humans rally behind him.  He hikes the mountainous mound of bodies and leaps from the top.  Landing behind an unsuspecting Brady.  Bledsoe inserts the needle into one of Brady's butthole ports and begins to inflate.  With NFL regulated air pressure his system begins to shut down.  He falls to a knee shaking the ground.  Lights flicker in his system.  He pushes his chest in the air, and with the remaining power he let's a death rattle scream ""NOOOOO!!!!"""

Fluke play, just like the Minneapolis miracle from a couple years ago. Which is why he's Joe Flukeco because without it, he would probably be super bowl-less based off his career, which isn't all that. Wasn't very thrilled we got him at QB either. Lol

Edit: just curious, but I wonder how many times you could do this before they put a stop to it. Belichick did it twice and Vrabel did it 3 times, eventually the refs would tell you to stop right? Awarding a harsher penalty wouldn't be sufficient because you could just keep backing up and burning the clock since this strategy technically works until you're under 5 minutes.

The funniest thing is he's literally doing the exact same thing he did in Miami, little dump passes, making his QB rating look amazing because everything is short little passes.  And now everyone think he's doing this amazing thing in Tennessee, the only difference is he has an O-line and a RB now, so it's easier for him to hide.

I can't remember the last time a RB pushed a team through the playoffs and to a Superbowl win.  Just looked it up, RB has been MVP only 7 times in SB history, and not since 1998. 

Could it happen?  Sure.  We've seen RB help lead teams to a SB win, just not do it all themselves."

That‚Äôs fine. Get rid of it. Still puts Broncos down by a touchdown.

> 3rd down on their own 30 with 35 seconds left and no timeouts. Chances are, they weren't gonna score a touchdown if Moore didn't misplay the ball for the 70yd TD.

Again, stupid fucking argument to make. Moore did misplay the ball. Just like Ayenbedajo tripped to allow a punt return TD. Just like Chykie Brown went for a big hit instead of wrapping Holliday up, and allowed a kickoff return TD.

I personally wouldn't make any QB throw the ball outside of 3rd and long or play action shots like they were in that situation. Even Lamar Jackson gets a low passing load when the runs are rolling, though he's obviously a contributor to that success."

Yeah, thanks to a complete fuck up play on the ball by Moore. A FS should NEVER allow a WR to get behind you. 

> Can‚Äôt compare those two guys doing their job to a fluke return

lol

> Certainly couldn‚Äôt blame Ayenbedajo for tripping over his own feet when he had a hand on Holliday for the punt return. 

[He didn't even trip over his own shoes..](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-cant-miss-plays/0ap2000000125256/Divisional-Can-t-Miss-Play-Trindon-Holliday-89-yard-punt-return-TD) Your boy just got outran by an athletic sprinter, Holliday was fast asf

> That‚Äôs fine. Get rid of it. Still puts Broncos down by a touchdown. 

It seems to me like you forgot the whole argument at hand; the misplay by Moore.

You wanna remove the kick returns, let's remove the pick-six and that play - which is a stupid argument to begin with, only trying to make your points 'valid'. Looks to me like it would be a tie game, now what?

> Also had two interceptions. Who‚Äôs to say he couldn‚Äôt have thrown another?

The pick six one wasn't even his fault. Off the fingers of Decker, he's done plenty of stupid things when he was playing for Denver - so not a surprise.

So who isn't to say he wouldn't have lead them down the field for another td/fg or hell, just a punt?

> Again, stupid fucking argument to make. Moore did misplay the ball. Just like Ayenbedajo tripped to allow a punt return TD. Just like Chykie Brown went for a big hit instead of wrapping Holliday up, and allowed a kickoff return TD.

Ayenbedajo didn't trip - as shown by the video above, Holliday was just too fast for him. [Brown didn't go for no big hit,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0od0JzfLK4) Holliday was just too fast for him, too.


> Players fuck up. It happened to both teams. You can‚Äôt just subtract one play that didn‚Äôt go your way and say ‚Äúyeah, but...‚Äù

That's how ""What if's"" work, though... Minimal succeeding scenarios that would change the game. Just like SB 49, *what if they ran the ball?*

There's a big different between my argument of Moore's play vs you wanting to remove kick returns, or assuming Manning could've thrown more Ints instead if those kicks weren't returned.

One, the punt return happened within the first 3 minutes of the game - 57 more minutes left - and two, the kick return happened at the start of the 2nd half - 30 more minutes left to play. 

You even were trying to claim this in another comment, lol 

""And if Ayenbedajo or Chykie Brown learn to tackle, Rahim never has a chance to misplay a ball.""

That's WAY too much time left in the game to start tossing out ""What if""

____

3rd down, at their own 30 with no timeouts left and the clock is running under 40 seconds. So if Moore makes the right read on the ball and knocks it down at the least. That puts the clock under 35 seconds with 4th down and 70 yards to go. [Of the last 21 seasons, the odds of a team scoring a touchdown with those very similar circumstances are low - 1.6%.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/drive_finder.cgi?request=1&year_min=1999&year_max=2019&game_type=E&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&week_num_min=0&week_num_max=99&start_event%5B%5D=Downs&start_event%5B%5D=Interception&start_event%5B%5D=Punt&start_event%5B%5D=Blocked+FG&start_event%5B%5D=Missed+FG&start_event%5B%5D=Fumble&start_event%5B%5D=Muffed+Punt&start_event%5B%5D=Blocked+Punt&start_event%5B%5D=Kickoff&start_event%5B%5D=Onside+Kick&start_event%5B%5D=Own+Kickoff&start_event%5B%5D=Muffed+Kickoff&end_event%5B%5D=Touchdown&end_event%5B%5D=Fumble&end_event%5B%5D=Interception&end_event%5B%5D=Downs&end_event%5B%5D=End+of+Game&exclude_kneels=1&drive_st_gtlt=lt&drive_st_own_opp=Own&drive_st_yds=30&drive_end_gtlt=lt&drive_end_own_opp=Own&drive_num_gtlt=gt&start_quarter%5B%5D=4&end_quarter%5B%5D=4&end_quarter%5B%5D=5&minutes_max=00&seconds_max=35&minutes_min=0&seconds_min=00&margin_min=-7&margin_max=8&order_by_asc=Y)

So with that, your ""What ifs"" are terrible because of how much game left to be played and not one that basically decided the game like that bomb to Jones. lol

He was purposely getting delay of game penalties to run the clock down. Then purposely did a false start while running the clock down. Third time he can't get delay of game penalty again so he lets the clock run until they have one second left to kick the punt.

Didnt overly follow Oakland but I know the Patriots missed a lot of Oline consistency due to injury and Brady was under way more pressure this year than previous years. They were down to a 3rd string center for a bit.

Belichick, now in a more pleasant mood, sits down and sinks into his living room couch, and reaches for the remote. He mumbles something about it being misplaced all the time. He finds the remote, and then mumbles to himself, again, without showing any emotion on his face: ""We're on to the lumbar support pillow"". Now he can finally relax, and hopefully take his mind off of his job for a precious few hours.

He does that by watching game film. For six hours, he reviews every play made in the ill-fated Titans @ Patriots game. He looks at the O-Line, then rewinds. He watches Brady, then rewinds again. Now he's trying to watch Edelman, but he notices his eyes have been slowly drifting into the Titans sideline. Towards Vrabel. And that's where they stay for another hour and a half of game film. He watches as the Titans shave away time, second by second, to run out the clock. He remembers how angry he was. He looks at Vrabel on the sidelines again, and pauses the film.

It's 20-13 for the Titans.

Belichick wipes away a tear from his eyes.

The AFC East has the most wins since the divisional realignment in 2002. Since the Patriots streak of 11 straight divisional titles began, the AFC East has the most wins from the bottom 3 teams of the division across the league. The same holds true if you begin in 2000.

The news sources that reported the walkthrough filming at the Rams super bowl both redacted the pieces they wrote about it and issued apologies.  (ESPN and Boston Herald).  Regarding spygate, teams are allowed to film other teams‚Äô signals, just not from the sidelines.  People around the league (Bill Cowher, Jimmy Johnson, Tony Dungy) have admitted both that signal stealing was commonplace and that they don‚Äôt think it gave much of a competitive advantage, if any.  Did the Patriots break the rules?  Yes.  Are the rule violations so egregious that it warrants putting an asterisk next to their accomplishments?  Should the 90‚Äôs Broncos championships have asterisks because of their salary cap shenanigans with Elway and Davis?  
How about Shanahan admitting in 2002 that he hired lip readers to steal signals during games, and that often they‚Äôd have the other team‚Äôs signals by the end of the first quarter?  (I know, I know, it wasn‚Äôt against the rules)  Do you really think filming signals (which other teams admittedly did) from an illegal place in the stadium is ethically any worse than what the Broncos did with the cap and signal stealing?  At the end of the day, neither thing is a big deal and it‚Äôs unreasonable to suggest either set of violations was responsible for either team‚Äôs impressive championship runs.

The Patriots are critiqued more harshly than other teams who cheat (like your Broncos, who are responsible for many of their own rules violations) because of jealousy over their absurdly long run of success.  Fan perception about spygate and deflategate has been informed mainly by sensationalist media and incorrect assumptions, and when you look at the context of the violations and the reactions around the league, it is obvious that all of it has been blown way out of proportion.  

There‚Äôs really no way to quantify to what degree x kind of rules violations helped x team, so I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs much of a point saying ‚Äúbut the patriots cheating is worse than the broncos cheating!‚Äù  At the end of the day every team cheats in one way or another.  Do you genuinely believe, deep down, that the patriots wouldn‚Äôt have been the best, or one of the best dynasties ever, if they hadn‚Äôt committed minor rules violations on par with the violations of other teams?

I‚Äôm not sure how you can say pumping crowd noise is no big deal but videotaping from an illegal location (when every single team steals each other‚Äôs signals) is egregious.  Try your best to be objective and apply your principles consistently across the board.  If you‚Äôre going to condemn the Patriots‚Äô championships as tainted by cheating, be sure to condemn the Broncos‚Äô championships for the same reason.  They were docked draft picks in three different seasons for their shady cap activity.  Am I offended by it?  No.  Do I need to discredit the Broncos because of it?  No.  But then again I‚Äôm not deranged by jealousy."

You are playing against the best QB ever and the rule still guarantees, basically, that he will get the ball back. Vrabel has a reputation for having ""huge balls"" in these situations. When it pays off, it seems highly intelligent, but every once in a while his strategies don't and it leaves you scratching your head. If the Pats walked down the field on the next drive, everyone in post-game would be calling him out for purposely giving the ball back to the most successful post-season QB ever.

In the end, it was a smart move by a guy that knows the Pats QB, their coach, and really their whole organization. Vrabel has confidence in his players and I love that he doesn't break from his aggressive tendencies just because common knowledge tells you not to give the ball to Tom Brady in a one point game. I think that is another reason why the league isn't going to look at this rule in the off-season.

Also, thank you for the great description of Vrabel's thought process and Titan up.

That's *exactly* the point of talking about hypotheticals: to initiate further discussion that many people find fun and interesting.  If you don't like discussing alternative outcomes, then nobody is forcing you to participate.  This is something people do with literally every sporting event, but I'd argue that the play-by-play nature of football and the isolated decision making it entails makes it more conducive to such discussions.  

> The right decision is the one that gets the win.

There are likely many possible paths to victory for both teams.  Performing a postmortem on key decisions and discussing potential alternatives for those moments is actually a key learning technique for the coaches and players themselves.  Even if a team walked away with the win, that doesn't mean the win didn't come *despite* a poor decision.  I like how /u/Blewedup put it below: 

> I drove home drunk and didn‚Äôt kill anyone. So that means it was ~~a good~~ the right idea!

It might have worked out fine in the end.  You avoided death or a huge legal penalty, but it doesn't mean that upon recap we can't determine it was a terrible decision.  

I'm inclined to agree that running the clock down to 5 min before giving the ball back when you're only up by 1 point isn't exactly the best strategy.  It was a somewhat poor decision that they, luckily for them, didn't get punished for.  5 minutes is a pretty standard football drive.  The game was still 100% in the Pat's control.  They had the chance to execute or not.  If anything, if I were the Pats, I would have welcomed them lowering the clock, because unless they were able to magically lower it below 2 minutes, then all that meant were the Patriots offense would have plenty of time and would decrease the chances that the Titans would get the ball back with enough time to retaliate.  

If the Titans were up by 9 points or more, however, I'd say that's a fantastic strategy, as every second counts at that point.  It's much more difficult to fit 2 scores in 5 minutes than in 6.5 minutes."

The clock wouldn't immediately start, no, but after the Titans took a penalty I think it would just be reset to :25 and the clock would start on the ready for play.

The way I see it, you‚Äôre basically guaranteed at minimum, a 6 win record at the start of every season because your rivals are the Jets, the Dolphins and the Bills; two of whom have been openly ‚Äútanking‚Äù for the better part of a decade (or 2?) and the third who, despite playing the other 2 teams, still has trouble getting the wild card spot every year.

Put it this way ‚Äî if you can go .500 against your non-divisional opponents you‚Äôre basically at 11-5. If you‚Äôre a ‚Äúdecent 9-7 team‚Äù in any other division, you probably go 13-3 which should be enough for a 1 seed and home-field advantage until the super bowl. 

With the threat to miss the playoffs at nearly zero, it allows your team the chance to experiment with back ups to keep starters fresh for big games, run stupid trick plays to expand the playbook, and take the time you won‚Äôt need to game plan division rivals to take up hobbies like videography.

I‚Äôm not impressed by Brady and Bill - I wouldn‚Äôt expect less from any of the other decent teams in the NFL; GB, Pitt, NOLA, KC, LAR, Minn, and maybe whoever is left after the suicide pact which is our NFCE. I think Rogers in the AFCE wins 6 or more. Same with Brees.

All else equal? No, of course not. But all else is never equal. If he had fewer yards total, but more air yards, then he had a better season. If his run offense was better one year than another, then they'll steal TDs from his passing stats as they become relied on more, and he'll also throw more interceptions total if his passing is relied on more, even if he throws the same number of INT/ATT. Context matters, unless you don't care about QB evaluation and just want to throw out stat buzzwords.

Oh, and passer rating doesn't include a component for QB rushing and QB sack avoidance, which are **massive** elements of being a QB in the modern game.

>excluded the majority of the seasons ai mentioned

Because that's as far as back as QBR goes. And even if he had worse years back then, having a bad year at 42 is infinitely more meaningful than having a bad year at 24. It's a sign of a career that's ending."

The issue, however, if you take a look at pure numbers, then yes, and that's one of the major problems with self-described ""analysts"" who can say, well this happened, and this didn't, so I'm right (which, let's face it, is the raison d'etre of a lot of ""analysts"" out there: to continually prove they are ""right,"" context be damned), but you may not have watched the game.

The Patriots offense stunk up the place.  Punting FROM YOUR OWN 32 is the right call, as going for it and failing means instant points (or points attempts) for the opposing team.  Punting and grinding down the clock and telling an offense that has struggled mightily for several games to beat you is a fair coaching choice, and not one I think is vulnerable to much reasonable criticism, win or lose."

I mean, I'm inclined to agree that ego gratification is the source of much of the ""fun"" behind these conversations for some people.  People get to feel smart and knowledgeable when they discuss these things, which makes them feel good.  We can go much deeper into that dynamic of this whole situation if you want. 

But without doing that just yet, let me just say that I get being annoyed by that and wanting to join in to poop all over everyone's self-aggrandizement parade, but I find it a much better policy to just be okay with it and allow everyone to have their fun.  

> The Patriots offense stunk up the place...Punting and grinding down the clock and telling an offense that has struggled mightily for several games to beat you is a fair coaching choice. 

I agree with that sentence, but argue that that logic would still apply if the Titans had punted at 6:30 instead of 5 minutes.  Either way, they were still punting and still giving the ball back to the Pats, and still challenging their offense to go down the field and score to beat them.  EXCEPT, doing the same exact thing at 6:30 instead of 5 minutes would likely give the Titans more time to retaliate if the Patriots did manage to score.  

That is, in both scenarios, the Patriots get about an equal chance to score, but in one scenario, the Titans get a better chance to score back.  It seems one approach is objectively superior.  In both scenarios, if the Pats failed to score on that next drive, that was probably it for them anyway.  I will admit that if the Pats went 3 and out AND the Titans subsequently went 3 and out, albeit while burning some clock with running plays, then initiating this sequence with 6:30 left on the clock would have potentially given the Pats more time for a 2nd final drive.  That's the only pro of the 5 minute strategy I can think of, and it relies on *both* offenses failing, which would make me personally less likely to want to take this route."

Coaching is too complex, it‚Äôs a lot easier to call it with players outplaying one another than coaches in a specific moment making a good judgement call, you know. 

Think of it this way, which is how I‚Äôm thinking about it, it would be like if it was overtime. And Tannehill goes down the field, scores a TD and the game ends without the Patriots getting a chance to answer back. That would be similar to saying Tannehill outplayed Brady in OT.

Performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) are used by players to illegally improve athletic performance above what legal training and preparation can do.

Players who illegally improve their performance unfairly penalize players who follow the rules. They not only put those players at risk for physical injury, but they also affect their economic livelihood by impacting their perceived value and their ability to secure appropriately-valued playing contracts.

 Tryoutgate (1980)

  The Philadelphia Eagles [forfeited a third-round draft pick](http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/55927/history-on-lost-draft-picks) for holding an illegal tryout. 

&#x200B;

 Bountygate (1989)

 On November 23, 1989, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Dallas Cowboys 27‚Äì0. Following the game, which was broadcast on CBS and later dubbed the [Bounty Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_Bowl), Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson [alleged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW9oYaSQdg) that Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan had taken out a bounty on two of the former's players, kicker Luis Zendejas and quarterback Troy Aikman. 

 

Deflategate (2004)

 Ex-Eagles and retired Pro Bowl quarterback **Jeff Blake** confessed in an interview that removing air from footballs [was common](http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2015/01/needles_on_sidelines_former_jets_qb_jeff_blake_had.html) when he played in the NFL from 1992-2005.

""I'm just going to let the cat of the bag, every team does it, every game, it has been since I played,"" the ex-Eagles QB said Wednesday in a radio interview on the ""Midday 180"" show on Nashville's 104.5 The Zone. ""Cause when you take the balls out of the bag, they are rock hard. And you can't feel the ball as well. It's too hard.

""Everybody puts the pin in and takes just enough air out of the ball that you can feel it a little better. But it's not the point to where it's flat. So I don't know what the big deal is. It's not something that's not been done for 20 years.""

Blake says that he'd order ball boys to let air out of his footballs just before the start of games during his entire NFL career, which included time with the Eagles in 2004.

 Tampergate (2015: Maxwell) 

 The NFL sent [memos to several teams](http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12457029/nfl-investigate-teams-early-deals?addata=module-b), telling them to hold on to their phone records because the league would be investigating agreements teams reached with players during the three-day negotiating period.

The news came a day after the NFL sent letters to all 32 teams, stating its displeasure with the release of contract terms before free agency officially began at 4 p.m. ET March 10, 2015. ""The memo makes clear that we will look into any potential violations of the rules,"" said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.

The NFL sent its memo after news leaked, beginning March 8, 2015, of several agreements between high-profile free agents and teams, including Ndamukong Suh with the Dolphins, Byron Maxwell with the Eagles and Jeremy Maclin with the Chiefs.

The legal tampering period began on March 7, but teams were not allowed to agree to contracts with players on other teams during the negotiating period, which ended March 10.
