-49ers barely beat Seahawks. If 9ers had lost, they would've gone to Philly and the Seahawks would have hosted a game while the Saints got a bye.

-Dolphins somehow beat Patriots. Chiefs get a first round bye and the Patriots lose to the Titans the next week.

-The Titans barely getting into the playoffs after the Steelers led the race for the second half of the season. The Steelers probably wouldn't have beaten the Patriots or the Ravens.

-The Vikings upsetting the Saints out of nowhere in overtime. The Saints would have gone to Green Bay while the Seahawks would go to San Francisco, where they won earlier this year.

479 points scored. +169 point differential. 144 yards/game and nearly 30 points/game. 23 rushing TDs. One of the most dominant seasons by a tight end ever. A three headed monster at running back. 27 turnovers on defense, 48 sacks, and surrendering less than 300 yards a game.

The Niners defense is really good and you need a really good defense to win big games with your running game because you can’t rely on rushing if your team goes down 2-3 scores. 

However, I don’t think it’s good enough to win the SuperBowl with the offense strictly rushing like the Niners did tonight and last week.

Jimmy G didn’t have to work the last two games but he’s going to have to make the big plays in the SuperBowl and the game is going to be much more on his shoulders than it has lately and that’s going to make this SuperBowl really exciting because he’s capable and so is Mchomie.

These teams are pretty evenly matched and I think the game is going to come down to the last possession. Either Jimbo or McHolmes is going to be in a situation where they can win the game on the last drive, that’s my prediction. It will be interesting to see who clutches it."

How do we know this was sponsored by State Farm?

You really don't know, you should call State Farm to find out.

Naw, it's not that big of deal.

That's what people without State Farm insurance say when getting hurt.

Ok

Ok

So... what did you do the other day?

Went to a State with a Farm in it

Really? Did you really have to bring up State Farm again?

Yes, I really did.  It's a State Farm of mind

Sigh...

So how many commercials are you guys going to run during the Super Bowl?

Oh, we plan to run many, many State Farm commercials!  We are paying Patrick Mahomes to say ""STATE FARM! SATE FARM!"" right before he snaps the ball on the opening drive.  It will be perfect promotion, beating out the competition for 1st commercial by having it live in game.

Isn't that illegal?

WE WILL MAKE IT LEGAL!

A prequel meme, nice!

Thanks, want to know how Palpatine survived the Death Star explosion because episode 9 didn't explain it at all?

Sure

He had State Farm insurance!  Not only did State Farm save his life, it saved him a lot of credits to fund his hidden army, he other wise wouldn't have had, with his insanely huge medical bills.  Turns out even being a evil Sith lord cannot overcome costly medical bills, not in this galaxy or in a galaxy far far away, but State Farm is only 1 call away."

I think this pretty much proves that the 2019 League (and hopefully future seasons) has finally moved on past the ""Yeah, the Patriots are just gonna win"" era and we're finally getting to see a lot of variance in team composition.  If the Titans can come back from what looked to be an abysmal first half of the Season to where they are now and teams like the Vikings and Packers can get to divisionals with the Patriots having to actually sit this shit out thanks to getting beaten by two underdogs, I think it's safe to say we're finally getting the ""good"" kinda drama that we've been longing for awhile."

In the scores that Rodgers had today it's the same story as always, if you give the ball to Rodgers he can find time to make a score.

So as a HC would you not make it as lop-sided of a possession as possible. Jimmy has shown he can do well in a shoot-out if needed against the saints, but if you have a comfortable lead it makes sense to do whatever you can to let that clock run as fast as you can."

Packers were driving, coulda got to half 17-7, instead fumble led to a quick 3 points and then Rodgers threw the bad INT to allow them to add 7 more right before half.

At 17-7 it's a different ball game. All that being said, Rodgers still finished with an okay game. Shoulda been 3 TD passes since im.not sure how they overturned the Jimmy TD since you couldn't tell where in his arm the ball actually was when he went down.

If not for that chuck it INT it would have been the 3rd best performance vs the 49ers this year(with the int it fell to 4th). Which sounds pretty good until you realize that the 3rd and 4th best games vs the 49ers this season were pretty much average games by the rest of the NFL standards.

49ers defense just too good. The Packers got straight up beat by the better team. It's just frustrating seeing Rodgers torn to shreds. Dude literally cant play bad and win. They've won just one postseason game in his career where hes been average or worse.

They've also only lost a single game with Rodgers when the packers were favored in the post season so it's not like.hes out here choking."

This also enables him to scramble around better to extend plays and Seattle’s offense has done a great job through the years of playing to this strength and tailoring the playbook and their receivers are the best in the league under the scramble drill. 

And to be clear that’s not a knock on Wilson but praise for the SEA organization. The fact that they are intimately aware of **who** they have and play to each and every one of his strengths is a testament to their success. I love to hate that dude cuz he’ll just kill your hopes over and over.

I find it interesting when you have these ""video game"" versions of real life stuff (can be sports games, card games, etc.) and what they do to imitate their dominance or their lack thereof.

I remember when I was kid playing NBA Jam during the SNES days and the Utah Jazz, NY Knicks, and the Chicago Bulls were objectively the top tier teams in-game."

It's not even just about that broncos Seahawks Superbowl or the specifics. U can also ask the 02 Raiders, the 07 Patriots or 11 Patriots, or even the 11 Packers. Ur team has to be more balanced...and usually when these types go against a great defense and more balanced team they falter. Also, Denver absolutely did have the explosiveness that this Chiefs team has...as far as weapons go they just didn't have anyone with the speed of Tyreke Hill. But that's about it.

""Jimmy runs a sprint draw nine times to get into the end zone. The next series, he starts with a sprint draw.
