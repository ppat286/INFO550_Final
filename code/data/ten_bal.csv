The Titans beat the Patriots in Foxbourough. A Patriots team that was slumping, limped into the playoffs, and lost to a legit bottom 3 team in the league (The Dolphins, also hoes) at home, in a game that could have won them a potential bye.

Yes Derrick Henry is a good, bruising style RB. I ask you what good is a game manager RB when you are down 3 TDs?? Tannehill will be forced to throw against a secondary that has 2 ALL PRO CBs.

We are going to destroy the Titans. Our offensive is a fucking buzzsaw. Our defense is stacked and hungry. Lamar is playing better than Jesus right now.

>* Lamar is still young, playoffs different than regular season. Some of these balls that he throws that are off target but get caught because his WRs are so open will likely not end the same in the playoffs.

* Ravens too hot, teams almost always lose one in these long streaks. What is the longest winning streak including the Super Bowl to win? Ravens can only hope it is before the playoffs, perhaps their next game?!
* Lamar at greater risk than most QBs of getting knocked out of a game do to his style."

The fact is he is a great talent but still has a lot to learn and grow.  And he is not unbeatable. 

Obviously, media won't admit they went overboard with the worship. I am already seeing on Twitter from sports analysts how Lamar Jackson gave it his everything as per his passing and rushing yards while no comment on the completion % and turnovers. Apparently it was his team that let him down. Personally, I think the whole team was flat but that also includes Lamar Jackson.

Anyway, it will be interesting to see how Lamar Jackson and the Ravens adjust their game strategy next season as teams start to figure out how to contain their QB. I still think they will be a force to be reckoned with but it probably won't be as easy as this season."

But its the dropped passes that really did in the Ravens in my eyes.  Multiple first downs, completions to set up short second downs - constant drops.  The receivers did not step up to the plat tonight.  Lamar shoulders a part of this too - he had some great throws, but often they forced the receiver into a position to fail.  He played like a second-year player, someone who hadn't had to shoulder all of it, and it showed.  He'll come back next year with a chip on his shoulder.  

Meanwhile, I don't know how Vrabel makes it through airport security with that brass in his sack, holy SHIT the calls were something else.  The defense was damn-near perfect for stopping a running threat like Jackson - take away the easy inside seam routes and runs, force him outside, and spy.  The Henry throw was genius too.  But this all starts and ends with Derick Henry continuing his star-making playoff run.  

I saw a comment previously comparing Henry's run to Fitzgerald's 2008 run and the parallels are there, if not the legacy.  One guy puts the team on his back and carries them onward.  Amazing stuff from Derick Henry.  Amazing."

The Titans were just better from top to bottom today.  Jackson didn't choke.  He wasn't great but that wasn't a choke.  His oline just got no push on those 4th down attempts, and the Ravens basically only have 1 receiving target who's above average.  It's ridiculous that they weren't getting open on those scramble drills.  Jason Witten basically would've saved 2 or 3 drives.

They were maintaining their holes rather than overcommitting on run plays. That the Ravens runners to run horizontally looking for a clear hole in the defense.

Lamar is a great QB, but he still doesn't have enough finesse to make all the throws. Passing over the middle is significantly easier in the NFL because you can rely on arm strength. Outside passing requires touch and timing - something much more demanding of young QBs.

Because they were maintaining gaps, the Titans LBs were easily able to take a few steps back to clog up the middle with a zone. This limited open throwing lanes to the TEs and vertical routes their receivers ran over the middle."

The Ravens were only down 7, on their own 40, not converting that 4th down leads to good field position and ends up being a TD the next play. And it's not like the Ravens are bad defensively either, but it just ended up putting even more pressure on their offense.

I understand going for it instead of the FG later on, but I don't think it's good football to always go for it on 4th and short. Saw some people saying Titans should have went for it on like 4th and 4, with a few minutes left to try to really close the game, but that just seems ridiculous to me.

I think he was pretty unlucky in the first half with all of the dropped passes and the tip that lead to the pick. That first half could have easily played out differently with those big gains. We see he was still making accurate passes and big plays throughout the game. 

Also, most importantly, the Titans deserve more credit than the Ravens deserve blame. Outstanding individual play across the board ensured the Ravens were playing catch-up from the very beginning. After that Henry TD pass, you could see the impatience in Lamar's decision making lead to some uncharacteristic mistakes. 

Not to mention the defense. We saw last week how they stopped the Pats 4 times on the goal line to effectively win that game. This defense was able to stop the Ravens on 4th down every single time when they've had so much success on those during the season. 

Just an amazing performance by everyone on that Titans sideline."

They’re a pack of frontrunning bullies who spent pretty much the entire season running up the score on inferior opponents and dancing all over their graves. But anytime they have to face adversity — real adversity — they fall apart. Lamar, in particular.

It’s not a coincidence that Lamar has never won a game in which he trailed by two or more scores. It’s not a coincidence that Lamar’s MVP campaign only took off after the Marcus Peters trade. Peters turned their suspect defense into an ELITE unit. With Peters, they were able to shut down the likes of Russell Wilson, Tom Brady, and Deshaun Watson and, at the very least, keep the games close enough for the running game to remain a viable threat. When the defense isn’t able to suffocate offenses, Lamar is forced to be an elite pure passer.

But he’s not. He’s not Russell Wilson. He’s not Patrick Mahomes. He’s not even Deshaun Watson. Elite quarterbacks can throw their teams back into a game. Lamar cannot. Elite quarterbacks don’t need custom made offense finely tailored to highlight their strengths and hide their weaknesses. 

Lamar will win MVP, of that I have no doubt. But don’t you dare try to tell me that he is an elite quarterback."

The defense played great for the most part, they gave up scores on short fields, but mostly they were good. 

Jackson had a couple bad plays on fourth down (a QB sweep under center is an all time horrible call) and his fumble is non-defensible. He needs to be better for this team to win. It’s built around him. Bad time for him to lay a total egg. Maybe his worst game of the year, in fact it was worse than KC or the first Cleveland game.

Titans also exposed the Ravens lack of receiver talent. Just played quarters all night and no one could get open because they don't have great route runners. 3 TE's who only run seam routes is not going to work when the run is getting shut down and the defense can just sit back. Ravens need to invest heavily in WR in the draft or free agency, preferably both. Luckily this draft is absolutely stacked at WR. 

Also I think Jackson was playing hurt tonight. He was throwing slow, wobbly balls like a 2015 Peyton. I wouldn't be super if we see something come out saying he had a shoulder injury. His sidearm passes looked somewhat good but his standard passes looked bad after the first drive."

For the past twenty years, Baltimore has built a reputation for a stalwart defense that kept their opponent in check while their offense were able to do their thing. Even if Baltimore was eliminated from the playoffs, they'd make sure they'd go out fighting.

This is the Baltimore team I remember seeing year in and year out.

This asskicking dished out by Tennessee was so out of character. Baltimore's strong offense was basically thrown against a brick wall, and Tennessee was going through Baltimore's vaunted defense like it was tissue paper.

Perhaps I should have known something was off when Lamar Jackson made that horse collar tackle after the first interception. I have never seen Baltimore caught so flat footed in all my years of following the NFL."

The Titans with Henry are going to be able to do all sorts of wrinkles with outside zone.  I think the future might be what looks like outside zone but with some sort of counter blocking to enable to ""cut back"" run which is more straight up the middle, like the 66 yard run.

The money short yardage play is going left which I would expect because of Lewan. But the Titans show heavy right then motion #81 left to create the outside zone possibility both left and right.

All the linemen and the other other tight end are flowing left, but Henry always intends to cut up the middle. So why not have #81 go back right and create a little counter action in the middle. I think Henry actually creates the hole before #81 fully gets there. This play might have another even better iteration by next season."

Lamar was not the problem in this game. He was the main reason we were within a score at the end of the half. Converted like 4 long third downs with his arm when the running game was completely dead. 

Came out in the second half and started making his Superman runs, and was still hitting big throws. God that 4th down was rough on the first 3rd quarter possession. Hated the play call. Give Lamar space to juke. 

The two 4th and 1 conversions truly swung the game from them being the better team but the Ravens keeping it close and sticking to our strengths, to them pulling away and forcing us to attempt a miracle comeback and completely scrap our game plan. 

I’m not saying woulda coulda shoulda AT ALL. The only thing I’m saying is better play calling on the 4th down and 1s ( and the 4th downs at the end of the game. I hated the Andrews pass) swings the game significantly. Lamar is unstoppable when he gets a lane outside the tackles and we ran it up the gut TWICE.

The defense did what they could too. They got every stop our offense needed to stay in the game. But the drops (one leading to a pick), the interior pass rush of the Titans completely crushing the pocket, and the WHACK running game killed us. and yes Lamar threw that bad second pick. 

Shit on the ravens. That’s fine. We looked like DOG SHIT today. But Lamar played like an MVP and our defense did their jobs. Those two entities gave everything they had and I’m dying on those hills."

But in all honesty, why the hell were we throwing the ball so much when our rushing is a lot better, especially when most of the receivers suddenly got butterfingers (which I'd probably attributes to the 2-3 weeks of rust).

The reality is that the Titans were just better than us on the handful of plays that mattered.

The drops were bad, some of Lamars throws were off, but at the end of the day if we get those 4th and short attempts we would have won this game. But on those plays the Titans were just better than us today, and they were plays we had reliably won all year.

If not for the drops Lamar would have put up an absolutely nasty stat line, but we still probably lose anyway because of being stopped on those 4th and shorts."

I honestly think we started to see the blueprint for how to beat Lamar here. Yeah, he busted some big runs, but the Titans did a good job containing him for a lot of it when they stayed disciplined. One of Lamar's massive runs was when the spy moved in and whiffed - the spy may have had a cue to go there, not sure - but he was still contained until the miss. On edge runs the titans had a couple really good plays where the D had a guy stand there and pause Lamar while other defenders ran in. Next year will be interesting to see whether Lamar takes the next step or whether NFL defenses catch up a bit. I'm leaning towards the latter but who knows."

I've spent the last few days in pure disbelief and it just doesn't make sense to me. I've spent the entire regular season watching the Ravens play great football it's just not fair.

If the Ravens lose again I will face that the Titans deserved the win, but I am just 100% sure it was a fluke and does a big disservice to the Ravens and the NFL."

Ravens were a top 10 worst tackling team; Titans were topish in broken tackles

Lamar is still only a 2nd year QB with pretty much no postseason experience except his loss last year

Titans have an incredible defensive front to put up against the Ravens rushing attack

Lamar can throw it deep well but his passes flutter at times, and the Titans have a very opportunistic secondary

The difference being they were gaining yards but got KILLED by mistakes. IDK why you would change the gameplan if you are constantly marching down hill.

Losing multiple drives to turnovers, dropped passes, and one to a really weird play by Lamar on 4th and inches isn't exactly on the coaching.

From a Ravens point of view we lost this game because we forgot the formula that got us to where we are and instead basically threw Lamar out there as said “do everything”. The amount of empty backfield sets I saw during this game made me want to vomit. Our RBs had 9 carries. I get that Ingram was limited, but where was Gus? We switched to panic, Lamar drop back every play, mode far to early still in the third quarter. Having only 1/3 of our plays be runs is just plain wrong. We had success in the regular season because we played to our strengths. Last night we played a sloppy game. The drops by receivers were a big killer. Also Lamar wasn’t nearly as good about taking care of the ball, and (not even mad at him for this tho, 79 plays for one person is absurdly ridiculous) Every single point that the Titans scored came after a turnover (on downs or otherwise).

From an outside point of view big props to the Titans. They were prepared and executed. Also Henry is a fucking truck. GG Titans."

As opposed to that the Ravens got stuffed on 4th and 1 (run plays btw), which had never happened all year. And made a fuck tonne of drops which hadn't happened all year. If either of those things reverse the Ravens could have easily ended up winning instead.

The Titans played really well. They beat ravens to the punch on 4th and short plays. Henry is a monster.

1. Every NFL game has the potential to be a “fluke.” As much as many of us have enjoyed shitting on the Patriots this year, that Miami game was the definition of what one would call a “fluke.” And I mean no disrespect to Miami by saying that. These players are **professionals.** They get paid to be the best of the best. A solid record doesn’t mean you are immune to defeat

2. Going by “conventional wisdom,” the Ravens didn’t have much business beating Denver in 2012. Denver was an iconic super bowl team, and the Ravens were underdogs to boot. Remember the Mile High Miracle? That goes somewhere on the list of all-time best Ravens plays. And yet, if you look at it objectively....Denver’s defense just completely botched that play. Run the same play in a simulation, and I bet they deflect it at least 50% of the time (and I’m being conservative with that guess). But not **that particular time.** *That* time, the Ravens pulled it off. That’s part of sports...and it’s a crucial part of playoff sports. 

It really doesn’t matter who you think the “better” team is in these situations. The Titans were undoubtedly the better team **tonight,** and that’s what mattered. Our amazing, awe-inspiring QB had two interceptions and a fumble. Our WRs and TEs were dropping passes like hot potatoes. We failed to convert two 4th&1s (I believe the second was 4th&Inches actually). The beauty of playoffs is that it doesn’t matter if something is a “fluke.” What matters is who tunes into the moment - and that wasn’t us tonight.

Don’t get me wrong...I’m utterly devastated. But so it goes, man. I said it in another post, and I’ll say it again: 32 teams, only 2 go to the SB, only 1 wins. That automatically means that amazing teams **won’t** make it. It fucking sucks. And I have no doubt that you’re correct: simulate this game 10 more times, and I bet there will be some results where the Ravens blow the Titans the fuck out. But there will also undoubtedly be other results where the Titans win again. Trying to define this as “the Titans robbing the Ravens of their full potential” is childish. The Ravens were 2-2 after a crushing loss to the Browns in Baltimore, only to win the next 12 games straight. They did everything in the book to prove that they were in control of their destiny. The Titans didn’t rob us - the Ravens did. And that sucks (and we’re going to hear *tons* of shit about that, because “sports” -  belee dat), but it’s silly to try to convince people that the team that beat us really had no business beating us. If they had no business beating us, then they wouldn’t have beaten us 🤷‍♂️ 

Sucks man, but unless you’re just a bandwagon fan (saying that in a general sense - not suggesting that **you** are), then you know we’ll all be back with our heads held high come September.

4599,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fe0bj84')>,fe0bj84,6,1578837565.0,"Tannehill is the biggest reason they are here right now.  His outstanding play in the regular season forced defenses to back off from the box which allowed Henry go wild.  Look at the NE game and watch a team that loved to vary it’s look and utilize cover 0 play almost exclusively 2 deep because it was scared of Tannehill hitting his receivers in man.  They had 6 in the box most of the night which invited Tennessee to run and their line got a great push allowing Henry to pick up steam.  If they had a pulse on offense they win that game.  Baltimore didn’t follow NE’s lead and got burned early.  Tannehill (and the WRs) built that 14-0 lead and put the normally extremely run heavy Baltimore offense in an uncomfortable spot.  Their run o is good and Baltimore was sloppy on offense so they did not need to go back to passing.  

To directly answer your question Mariota is not Bortles.  Advanced stats love him (CPOE king aka most accurate qb in the league with great EPA/Play) and they always hated Bortles.  However he’s very likely to regress since he’s never had a stretch anywhere near this, but he’ll probably be a better qb than Bortles even with that."

That was the most bend but don’t break I’ve ever seen- and shit that phrase is a staple of tomlin. Amazing. But I’m stuck thinking, “did they really shut down Lamar? 508 yards., so no.....but only 12 points.... so... yes?"

Make Lamar prove he can throw. He'll make some, sure. But when the Ravens get behind by 2 scores and forced to throw a lot, their offense breaks down. Lamar is prolific when it's a good mixture. But if you take away his running lanes, that's the key to victory. 

They're meant to play while ahead, which I'm not a fan of that philosophy as it's just win-more. Their offense is not great at coming back when the clock is a factor."

4th and 1 in the 1st Quarter on your own 45yd line should be the play people always point to when “aNaLyTiCs” gets brought up. 

There’s a lot of things those analytics don’t show (such as, usually its the better teams with favorable matchups that are taking those risks but that’s another discussion).   But what the analytics dont show is how HIGH risk and LOW reward that was.  

The Ravens still were 50yds away from the endzone

It was still the first quarter with a long game ahead and homefield advantage

The Ravens had a Top 5 defense, surely you have some faith in them

....

When they failed on 4th and 1, that was deflating.  It also sent a message of urgency, and really gave the Titans big confidence and momentum...also had the crowd a quieted down and the team a little concerned.  

Check the body language

Next play Touchdown for the Titans

Now with the failed 4th down play of urgency, the Ravens were extremely shaken up and on high alert

The weather was perfect (65degrees in January) and the crowds jaw was on the floor SILENT.  HOME FIELD ADVANTAGE WAS GONE 

HUGE.  

I’m telling you that 4th and 1 practically lost the game for them as much as you can lose a game in the first quarter

5150,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fe0a6au')>,fe0a6au,7,1578836270.0,"Man, I hate this kind of argument. Like the Ravens and saints losing is some kind of justification for anyone saying that the #1 seed isn't important, which is what going 14-2 in the regular season gets you. Regardless of record, securing the #1 seed is still important. Like, I understand the sentiment. In the NFL, there is so much luck involved within a single season simply because the law of large numbers doesn't have as much of a chance to affect things, and just getting yourself to the playoffs is a good thing. A chip and a chair at the table so to speak. But this doesn't mean getting yourself a bigger stack of chips going into the tournament is a bad thing. Saying ""going 14-2 doesn't mean anything""  is just tv talking head air filler bullshit to make the boomers jizz their pants about the good old days when men hit each other and passing was for pansies. 

Obviously going 14-2 doesn't guarantees you a Superbowl. But with so much luck being involved, it's incredibly important to eliminate luck wherever possible, and stack the odds in your favor as much as possible where is isn't possible. Getting a week 1 bye is one of those eliminating luck situations. In a tournament of people flipping coins against each other, the person most likely to win is the person who automatically moves on to the second round. 

Being the #1 also helps stack your odds for things like home filed advantage, where it's theorized that crowd noise has a statistically significant effect on reffing decisions, as well as some of the commonly known things like difficulty hearing the playcall, and playing in a place of comfort and not having to travel.   So now instead of flipping coins, maybe your throwing a D6 with two 6s against an opponent with a regular D6.

Tl;dr: fuck this. In a tournament of dice rolls, give me the situation that (a) lets me automatically move on without ever chancing my dice losing, and (b) a dice with generally higher numbers on them than my opponents. Yes you can still lose by throwing the only one on your dice, or by throwing a 5 and your opponent throws a 6 in the big tournament moments. But putting statistics on your own side is still important."

5252,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fe0f8or')>,fe0f8or,1,1578841196.0,no second decision was bad even if the playcalling was just bad. The Ravens offense was getting no production and Lamar literally had to carry the team to just get them to the position. We absolutely needed points because then  the game becomes one possession game and the Titans might have changed they playcalling. It was a complete momentum killer when Lamar FINALLY generated momentum. Now it it's 14-6 instead of 14-9. Then Henry decides he wants to eat again and now it 21-6. Then we decide to for 2 WHEN WE ALREADY loss 3 points from a should have been field goal. Absolutely disastrous.

It's entirely different  when you go for it on enemy territory or if your offense is producing. The ravens went for it in Titan's territory and when the score was 0-0. Then precede to go for it again when the offense just wasn't producing and when WE NEEDED POINTS to gain momentum.

This is simply something you don't do unless you want to be eliminated especially against a team that can score 14 points very quickly.

Ravens simply as a collective unit didn't show up. They forced Lamar to heavily carry his team and they couldn't make key plays to get scores. Lamar actually was throwing over them all game. Receivers were just bad at getting separation or dropped the ball (literally first game where we had 10+ dropped balls like wtf???).

The Titans just exposed  that we're lacking heavily in receiving talent. Only Hollywood Brown was making key catches. Hurst literally could have scored a TD except he dropped a ball that landed right in his chest."

However, his name often gets put up in the pantheon of American literature, which I think is underserved.  His works are really good at creating a bleak and suspenseful tone, but that’s about it.  None of what I read really goes into much depth thematically and all the characters in his stories are either bland or simply self inserts.  I think that many of his contemporaries like Twain (they weren’t writing at the same time but I’m talking about historical legacy so the comparison is relevant) were able to delve into more depth with more complex themes.  Poe isn’t a bad author, but his works leave a little to be desired.  The Raven is good at capturing a very bleak feeling of loss, but it doesn’t leave you mulling over any real thematic questions like a really great work of literature should, and I think that’s him in a nutshell: really good at setting a tone but beyond the surface there’s not much going on."

Honest question cause I didn't see either of those games.  Was there an actually blueprint or more just the Browns/Chargers playing lights out and the Ravens not playing well?"
5612,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fe0d0cu')>,fe0d0cu,24,1578839115.0,"Exactly. Defenses in the NFL are good but as a whole, the ""defense"" of any given team has a hard time adapting to completely new offensive schemes within any given season. It kinda mirrors the general offense vs defense struggle/philosophy of football that happens within a game - the offense should *theoretically* have the advantage because they at least know what they're trying to execute in the first place and the defense (usually) doesnt. Within any given play the offense *should* have the advantage but eventually good defenses start to scheme around tendencies and poke holes in the ""set up"" type plays that make the rest of the offense work. 

Everyone talks about the steps Lamar made as a passer (and kudos to him, he improved a lot in a short time) but hes an adequate passer at best right now. And he's only adequate in the context of his running ability. He needs to improve in passing by quite a bit as he (hopefully slowly) starts to lose tiny fractions of a second off everything he does with his legs. 

Anyone assuming he's a 100% lock to play at this high a level for more than a year or two isn't necessarily wrong but I think it's a way more fluid situation than most NFL fans would think. 

Personally, if I was drafting a dream team today I'm taking Mahomes over Jackson and it's not even close."

The poor fools.  They really did drink the hype Kool-Aid with Jackson.  Believed him to be infallible and the best player ever.

Even now, you can hear the gears turning on every excuse to make except accepting that Jackson isn't an elite GOAT HOF passer.  The word ""drops"" will be thrown around a lot with no mention of how many passes were so off-target that receivers had to contort their bodies to try to make the catch.  The offensive line will be blamed for any negative plays.  The defense will be crucified.  The coach will be blamed.  But accept that maybe, just maybe Jackson isn't the absolute best player to ever put on a jersey?  Nope.  They can't do it.

(Ever sadder, I think Jackson bought it.  That guy looked rough by the end of the game.  He better take the lesson to heart, or next year's going to be even more eye-opening for him.)"

I do agree, overall this was a different Ravens team that showed up tonight.  Yet it still doesn't change the fact the Lamar racked up yards when the Titans went to a conservative D.

They tend to be inside the 10 and gets them because teams have to play the run.  They're mostly easy dump off throws to TEs and RBs in the flats.

The guy is obviously a QB, and I think he's improved dramatically as a passer since entering the league, but the Ravens are like 28th in passing and everyone plays them run first.."

Your personnel is ideally 4 pass rushing DL, 2 smaller, athletic cover LB, 2 press corners, and 3 hybrid safeties.  The idea is to take away the shallow to medium routes in the passing game, and containing the edges in the run game.  Sacrificing 1on1 matchups on deep routes to blanket TE's and backs in the short and intermediate routes, use the DL to generate most of the pressure on the QB.  Lamar isn't good at throwing deep unless he has all day to throw, so the pressure from the front 4 is important and so are good cover corners.  He likes to pull it down and run when he sees an opening, which is contained by the smaller, more athletic LB's and DB's of which you have 7 to converge on him when he takes off.  You roll the dice that he won't hit a lot of deep throws where his receiver makes a play 1on1, and you give up chunks of yards between the tackles to Mark Ingram because you don't have run stuffing tackles or bigger linebackers.  Ingram had good games against us every time, but if you let them have that and get out to an early lead, they can't come back on you against that defensive strategy."

They obviously didn't play their best, and the Titans played really well, don't get me wrong. But Ravens were 4/4 when going for it on 4th and 1 in the regular season, so it could have been they they either got luck in the regular season and statistical regression hit them hard here where it mattered the most, or else they got unlucky this game.

Regardless, let's say the Ravens convert that first 4th and short, I don't think it's unreasonable to assume they're first to put points on the board. Alternatively, if they converted the second 4th and 1, it probably means one less touchdown for the Titans. Or even the 4th and 5 in the 4th quarter, where a TD and 2 point conversion would put them within a score.

Just to reiterate, I think the Titans played really good and the Ravens played bad. And I know underestimated the Titans going into the playoffs. But I still think that if you replay this game 100 times, the Ravens win the majority of the time. Maybe more like 60% though, whereas i would have had it more like 75% before this game."

Titans o-line has been winning at the line of scrimmage all game, but the real difference has been the Titans D.  They got 2 turnovers so far, and two fourth down stops.  Those fourth down stops were huge.  Lamar has looked good, but his receivers have had some bad drops.  It's hard to say how this has happened besides just a few major plays.

Titans receivers made two excellent touchdown catches.  Ravens couldn't convert two short fourth downs.  Late in the second quarter Hollywood made a great catch on a great throw and they had a shot at the end zone but didn't convert and settled for a fg.  That hurt too.

Lamar has been great except those two interceptions, one of which was a tipped ball.  

Tennessee is up 28-6 to start the 4th quarter, it's not impossible, but the crowd is silent.  Lamar's airing it out with little success.

Henry's been solid but unspectacular so far, outside of that 60+ yard run he ripped off.  He had another 20 something yarder earlier.  Titans have had great field position with the turnovers and 4th down stops.

Edit:  Lamar just put together a good drive and they scored.  I have a feeling this is where Henry's about to go to work.

tl;dr -  Ravens haven't been able to complete drives due to either turnovers (2 int, 1 fum) or being stopped on 4th and short."

I would say the 3 biggest reasons they lost (you decide the rankings)


* John Harbaugh didn't take the Titans or playoff competition seriously, that's why he made a dumb decision to go on 4th and 1 from their own 45 in the 1st

* Lamar Jackson played like garbage.   Who gives a shit what his padded stats were, when the game was tight, he did not look good.  Those 2 INTs (the first one was a high/bad pass) and fumble were bad.  He was trying to do way too much and put it all on him, or the play calling was over utilizing him and not doing anything with other players.  He sucked tonight

7064,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fe0a0cu')>,fe0a0cu,7,1578836119.0,"The injury thing is a distinct possibility... and one thing that makes me feel the Ravens don't see him as a long-term QB.  He runs way too often.  Yeah, they pretty much showed that unless they played a hilariously bad pass defense they had to have him running the ball to make defenses stack the box and free up defenders.  But you don't want the most important player on your team removing a lot of the protections he has and subjecting himself to more hits.  Even without a serious injury, those hits add up.

I remember reading a story about Steve McNair after he retired when he could have played a few more years and made a lot more money.  He said he got sick of telling his son that he couldn't play with him because he hurt too much to get out of bed after game days.  And a guy like Jackson's getting hit more than McNair did.  Early in his career, he's not going to feel it *too* much, but it's going to creep in and he'll be feeling it.

But the worse case is the higher chance of a devastating knee injury.  Sometimes you're lucky and it's just a few weeks out after surgery.  Sometimes your whole knee is destroyed and your career is basically over.

There's a good reason that even the most mobile QBs tend not to run that often.  People talk about guys like Deshaun Watson or Russell Wilson, but Jackson ran over twice as many times as either of them.  He ran 176 times, the next highest was Josh Allen at 109 and no one else over 100.  (In fact, only three QBs in the entire league were within 100 rushing attempts of Jackson.  That's... kind of insane.)  There were only 22 RBs who had more attempts during the season.  The more I look into stats and see how much they took the QB protections off Jackson and had him run, the more I'm wondering how his career is expected to last.  That's not sustainable.  The guy's going to worn down at best, hurt at worst.

But hey, I guess as long as he's flashy and ""fun to watch"" for now, that doesn't matter to the average fan.  Should definitely matter to the guy who's only currently got four years guaranteed and not for that much money."

Baseball doesn’t charge the pitcher the earned run if the runner got on base because of an error, INTs shouldn’t count towards QB when the WR gets his hands on it. 

The team shouldn’t have rested starters week 17. They started slow and that killed them. They got out coached. Play calling was horrible and defense was down right no where close to #4 ranked defense.

That first TD was a great throw and an even better catch and then he dropped it in the bread basket on the long TD throw. I had only seen he threw for less than 100 yards and didn’t realize he had some very key plays (not to mention I think he ran one in?)

Dude came up with enough to pull out a couple of massive wins. Gotta credit him where its due. 

Im hoping you win it all but Im not betting on it. Its possible for sure, but I think at some point he would need to have a 200+ yard, 2+ touchdown game to bring it home. I do give TEN a pretty good shot at least next week in the AFC title game. Like, I don’t see why they can’t hang with and beat these other teams. Its just a matter of how long they can stay hot.

“While the Bison pull in less revenue in terms of bulk dollars, there is far more bang for the buck in FCS than in most of the Group of Five. The fact of the matter is, NDSU has broad autonomy and a perennial national championship contender at the FCS level. Surrendering that autonomy for anything that isn’t a massive, sweeping upgrade is a bad trade for Bison football.”"

While the offense is obviously tailored to the way he plays, which leads to more running and less passing, his team averages 200 rushing yards per game largely due to great blocking and Mark Ingram (neither of which showed up tonight) plus Lamars otherworldly duel threat ability. No he’s not a great passer nobody should ever argue that he is one, which is why he should never be throwing 60 passes in a game.

He'll only get better, but it seems like the Titans were the first team to figure you guys out - as the commentators said, the Titans plugged up the middle and forced Lamar to go lateral for his runs - once you do that he's much easier to catch.

Ryan has less than 200 yards total offense in the past 2 games. Lamar had that in one game before “garbage time” its a team game.

Lamar had an early drop that was a Turn over that lead to a 45 yard run by Henry. Defense failed to stop the run. 

Whenever Lamar makes 1 mistake this sub says, “see I told you 43 weeks ago he was shit” It’s a team sport and 1 game at a time. Playcalling was bad. Defense was bad, receivers were bad, but let’s put all the blame on Lamar and say he’s washed up."

But if you gave me the choice between a quarterback that puts my team in the lead early, gets 3 TD's and takes care of the ball for the rest of the game vs a guy who gets a lot of yards, turns the ball over 3 times, and fails 4 fourth down conversions the choice is simple."

Yea We’re not the only one’s with a questionable coaching staff and the nation watched Harbaugh stare into the abyss for 60 minutes wondering “hey why aren’t we winning, i told the team we’d win easily and we’re better?” And literally did nothing to inspire anyone. 

Alot of good making other teams look like scrubs did for lamar. Btw our trash bag of a team almost beat him. 

But im sure Lamar will rack up alot of regular season wins in his career 👍"

But to act as if Lamar is a bust and ravens need to start over is fucking laughable. Almost beating them means fuck all mate. Good luck with burrow. Be sure to come back to ravens fans in 2 years to remind us how many times burrow has led y’all to the playoffs first. You deserve to get flexed on when you get absolutely curbstomped. If you don’t wanna get flexed on , maybe your team should play competitively instead of like dogshit."

He gets reckless and plays hero ball, he’s got to calm down and play his game. I love his competitiveness though, nothing really is a trap game with him under center like it was with Flacco. You’ll get his best shot regardless.

I agree completely. He’s also only 23, so he’s not even at his prime capability running the football yet which is also pretty scary. Oh well, time to enjoy the rest of the postseason"

No matter how you frame anything, it’s completely idiotic to say we have no future. It’s not like we’re drafting a perenial can’t get it done in playoff games qb like Lamar who has 10 td’s and 10 int’s in 5 bowl games/playoff games and burrow has 12 td’s in 2 bowl games and 73 for the season.

Ur not MVP caliber until u prove u are in the PLAYOFFS, where it actually matters. Otherwise nobody is going to consider u elite.

Yea, most of them ARE proven winners. That's the difference. I'm pretty sure Aaron Rodgers, Brady, Manning, etc have all got the big one. Even Matt Ryan has been to the Superbowl. That's the difference...those guys have actually won before and/or proven they are MVP caliber outside of winning a regular season award
