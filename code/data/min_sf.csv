32,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fdzc9e4')>,fdzc9e4,343,1578817571.0,"This may come out as hyper-aggresive and I apologize, but this game is the epitome of why Mike Zimmer is ultimately never successful despite the talent his teams have had over the years. Absolutely fucking gutless display on play calling— second quarter of the game, on the road as underdogs and you bail out of a drive on second down? What exactly are you trying to win when it's clear that the 49ers are not being slowed by your defense? 
He's gutless, cowardly play calling all game and punting while down 27-10 from your own 40? Jesus, at least show some semblance of balls, yes, you're not coming back at that point, but talk about flat-out quitting...

And yes, I'm aware that Stefanski is the Offensive Coordinator and he shares a lot of the blame too, but it is a known fact that Mike Zimmer has input on the calls as well. 
This is why he'll never win, you cannot win in the NFL if you don't take risks and actually TRY to win on offense. Runs on 3rd and an eternity aren't winning anything, punts while down 17 with nine minutes left aren't winning anything, and barking sarcastic quips at anyone that questions you isn't something he's even earned right to do compared to other *winning* coaches (not that winning gives you a right to be a jerk, but at least you have enough equity to get away with it a la Belichick).  

All year, just to go down like they were afraid all along... wow."

I hope they get some young talent to play interior in the off season to address that run game. Also a new CB to replace Rhodes is definitely coming this off-season.

I agree with the ""Play not to lose"" criticism in games. So many games where they go conservative while trailing. Honestly, this team could look a lot better losing.

The Vikings D also plays a soft zone and that was exactly how the 9'ers play offense. No wonder they get sluggish in the second half.

Overall a pretty good season on the Vikings. But the recurring problems on offense is that they only have ONE way to win games: Get the run game going, then go play-action. But once a team stops your run, suddenly this team is completely dysfunctional.

Hats off to the 9'ers. That defense is championship Calibur. Offense can pound the rock and Jimmy GQ plays as well as he looks. Not a bad game for a playoff debut.

Also a plus that they didn't have a tight emotional game to go through and will be well rested to play next week. 

Good luck next week, I'll be rooting for you to win the SB!

Sincerely,
An adult Vikings fan"

- People forget what this very same 49ers D did to the Packers and Aaron Rodgers.  Actualy, a less healthy Niners D then.  But we'll hear about that all week if they win today.

- The strength of the 49ees D is the pass defense, so the Vikes passing game was already behind the 8 ball.  Where the Niners are vulnerable is in the run and the Vikes managed all of 20- something yards.  So the only hope Cousins had going in was to get some help from Cook and Co., which never came.

- The Vikes OL got dominated at the LOS in the run and pass pro.  But Cousins sucks because he didnt overcome that."

It's been so frustrating to see people compliment his ""stats"" this season when the people commenting don't watch our games. Even people in our own sub have been in denial, but Kirk is not a big time quarterback. He does not have what it takes. This has been apparent for weeks. It was going to happen in the playoffs if it didn't happen today.

It's frustrating watching him on the sidelines, it's frustrating seeing all the hype for him that was completely overblown, it's frustrating seeing his stupid sleep number commercial. The dude allegedly micromanages every second of his day on an excel sheet? Watch your own fucking film dude. There are people open down the field. You have people open down the field constantly and you can't throw up a 50/50 ball to one of the best receivers in the league more than once a game.

Someone months from now will say ""oh but he had 4000+ yards and 30+ TD's! Be happy with what you have!"", you don't watch our games. You don't know. The guy chokes. He's a loser and losers lose. Especially big games.

""Wow, you're a negative fan!"" or ""Wow you call yourself a fan?"", fuck off. It's fine to be negative. It's fine to expect more from a team that was one game away from the Super Bowl last year but now suddenly has trouble converting first downs. I've been watching this team for more than 20 years and my father for longer. I've been let down many times. It's frustrating to see a team just not show up at home and have a quarterback completely throttle our cap.

The Redskins fans were right.

Brees is overrated. He’s a regular season baller but has consistently come up short in the play offs. As for the SB win, it was the run game, ballsy play-calling and defence which won it. Brees was carried to a SB win by those things.

I always heard you run the ball to wear out the opposing team’s defense. Additionally, while running tends to give you shorter gains it goes keep the chains moving thereby keeping your offense on the field longer and giving your defense time to rest. Scoring too quickly like Chip Kelly in previous years totally fucked his D. 

I’d say knowing how to play the game strategically is playing to win. Throwing the ball on 70% of plays hoping for some random chunk play is not smart either. That said, with 9 minutes to play and 3 scores down you gotta keep your offense on for all 4 downs. Can’t be punting it with the way the niners offense was hogging the clock."

Bradford - fragile AF. Couldn't even last a season after being gone from the Vikings.

Or how QB salaries have continued to go up since his signing that he's barely top 10 in cash, and if you rank QBs by salary it is right in line with where he ranks for performance (obviously excluding rookie contracts since those aren't basd on QB free market value).

“One of the key schematic alterations came from studying film of the Week 10 game in which the Falcons beat the Saints 26-9 in New Orleans. Atlanta defensive tackle Grady Jarrett led Atlanta with 2.5 sacks in that game, and Hunter said the Vikings saw a chance to make Brees uncomfortable by creating interior pressure, as opposed to having Hunter and Griffen only rush the Saints’ two stellar tackles, Ramczyk and Armstead.”

“There was a better match-up in the middle, so they put us in the middle to get more pressure,” Hunter said. “When he sees pressure, he’s not going to throw an accurate pass.”"

There is motivation there they can basically look at the first two games and say we can hang with them and they aren't that great. 

I don't want to play either team. Unfortunately we have too."

If they play again both teams know they are evenly matched and will have to bring their all to win. The Niners coaching staff will say look we jumped out to a 10 point lead both times and we need to finish those games just as we started them. And the Seahawks coaches will say look they jumped out to a 10 point lead both games but we finished strong so now let’s start strong. Neither team is gaining motivation from the first two games that the other team isn’t also gaining. 

Now that I think about it, it would be poetic for the Seahawks to come to Levi’s next weekend. The Seahawks will have followed the same path the Niners did when the Niners had to go to Seattle for the NFCCG. Being the 5th seed and playing an east coast game followed by beating the Packers in Lambeau then a a trip to their rivals stadium for the NFCCG to settle the season series.

None of that is true.

What actually happened is their main investor was arrested by the FBI for fraud and all his assets were frozen. They never ""staked"" their long-term success on a gambling app. They had plenty of investment money and the App would have been one part of their business strategy.

Then they had to find a quick investor and unfortunately ran into Dundon who only wanted to buy the AAF *for* the App. Polian and Ebersol figured out that Dundon didn't care if the AAF succeeded or not so started shopping around for a new majority owner. When Dundon found out he pulled the plug to keep the App and other patents.

2692,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fdzpdx4')>,fdzpdx4,3,1578821626.0,I have a hard time believing any fan that says a playoff loss doesn’t matter to them

Maybe so, although I honestly feel yall would have beaten Philly the miracle year. I do think any playoff game effects who wins that year tho by changing the bracket and matchups."
2694,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fdzyfep')>,fdzyfep,1,1578827649.0,"Yeah man you’re totally right. Maybe if us fans were more positive and believed in our team harder, the players would play better.

At the same time, we’ll do The Who dat chant every time we beat you at the dome! Like Payton and his skol chant! It’s all in good fun right?"

Yall being bitter over something from a decade ago (which btw, other teams had bounty systems too) doesn't make it a rivalry. It makes you look pathetic. By this logic, we should have a ""rivalry"" with seattle and la from previous losses, but we don't. We can get competitive, but suggesting that there's a rivalry between new orleans and minnesota is complete nonsense and does nothing but inflate your already fragile ego."

Our loser gets to rotate a trophy with a diamond dildo for last....and it has to be displayed on the 1st room of their home entered.  I (knock on wood) have yet to take that home."

You had one line at he end of your comment that you might be able to twist into “we should be happy with what we have.”  Don’t try pretend you were getting at anything else after the fact. 

And to be honest with you, most of us don’t give a fuck about what happened 10 years ago. You might see it, but that’s far from the majority of us, and it sticks with you because it bothers you"
