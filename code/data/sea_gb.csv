After reviewing the play, they determine that it was in fact a fumble. They also state that they did not see sufficient evidence of a packers recovery.

Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I'm concerned, neither of the teams are in posession of the ball after a fumble until it is recovered. So after ruling a fumble, they would also have to see sufficient evidence of a seahawk recovery in order to give them them posession. 

I simply don't get how it was determined that the seahawks should be granted posession automatically. 
Can someone elaborate?"

This ""Packers get all of the calls"" crap doesn't make sense.  *Why are they getting the calls?* Do you people think the league **is actually biased for the Packers**? I would doubt it. Seems bad for business.    


There is no motive for the officials to do this, and it's been going on for too long for it to be some weird fluke. It's a meme, and people who are critical of the Packers see what they want to see.

The Seahawks defense is atrocious. The stats back it up. We run the same old scheme, every single down, and don't have the personnel to make a straight-up simple scheme work.

Russell Wilson is amazing, but the Seahawks win by running, like so many good playoff teams do.

To lose Chris Carson and Rashad Penny ... it's not possible to overstate the debilitating effect this had. People know Chris Carson is great, and had 1200+ yards, but he's even better than his prolific production. And Rashad Penny was really coming into his own midway through the season, giving the Hawks huge chunk plays that really got the offense going at times. To lose both as a rushing team was just crippling.

Russell was brilliant, no surprise there.

And somehow, like all season, we make it a close game. That's the true strength and hallmark of the Seahawks this year. But losing the game by giving up 3rd and 8, 3rd and 9, 3rd and 10, over and over to close the game out also sums it up.

GG and good luck in the championship Pack."

The Packers are hoes. On them we shall stunt.

2 points:

1. The Packers beat the Lions in Detroit. A  Lions team that was slumping, limped out of the playoffs, and lost to a legit bottom 3 team in the league (The Redskins, also hoes), in a game that could have won them a potential playoff spot.

2. Yes Aaron Jones is a good, bruising style RB. I ask you what good is a game manager RB is when you are down 3 TDs?? Rogers will be forced to throw against a secondary that has 2 PRO CBs.

We are going to destroy the Packers. Our offensive is a fucking buzzsaw. Our defense is stacked and hungry. Russ is playing better than Jesus right now.

Really fucking frusterating to end the season like this again.

Also the refs in this game were embarrassingly bad both ways. There's no excuse at all for the way some of those plays were officiated, most notably Hollister's fumble on our first drive should never ever have been whistled dead, turnovers are automatically reviewed, let the play continue until its done if there's the slightest question!

**Edit**: Falcons are like our lil' brothers, and the rivalry feels like a fun rivalry rather than a mean rivalry. We've got some cross-divisional rivalries where it just feels mean, while the one with the Falcons feels like good fun and good sports. I been to games in New Orleans with Falcons fans walkin' down the streets, and they've never been anything but great:  we'll get ya! before the game, we'll get ya next time! after.

Plus, I love Matt Ryan as a player. I remember watching him in a Pro Bowl game where he was mic'd up and given some soft play to run near the end, and he said ""fuck that we're going for it"" on the air and did exactly that. I also appreciate that he speaks his plays directly to Coleman so Coleman can see his lips moving. All told, it puts him in the good place in my mind."

It was a 4th and 11 within field goal range for GB if they didn't convert. Green Bay had just gone three and out the last time they had the ball. Seattle still had all three timeouts and the two minute warning.

If Seattle didn't convert the down, Green Bay gets an easy field goal or possibly more just like that. And at that point it would be an 8 point deficit with \~2 minutes left to drive down the field. I like the odds of getting a defensive stop once more than scoring a TD plus 2 in that scenario.

His run-first philosophy is a sign of strength and courage. He IMPOSES his will onto opposing defenses with our good old fashioned ground and pound rushes getting stuffed at the line of scrimmage. The fact that he makes us a playoff team every year with a god-awful quarterback like Russell “Trent Dilfer” Wilson is PROOF that he is the greatest coach of all time. Remember that pick Russ threw in SB49? Completely Russ’ fault, no wonder Pete chooses to only allow Russ to pass >15 times per game nowadays. I’m glad Pete punishes him for that by giving him the worst pass protecting line in the league every year, he deserves it smh. All this new fangled “forward passing” is a bunch of 21st century nonsense Anyways. Who needs a Peyton Manning, or a Patrick Mahomes-like passing attack when you have a mean, gritty, bruising runner like Travis “Jim Brown” Homer to carry the ball for 3 straight quarters? With our brilliant strategy of not letting our stupid QB throw until the 4th quarter, we were able to defeat the mighty 1-15 Bengals! Truly a testament to Pete Carroll’s greatness. Go hawks!!

I’ve heard announcers mention many times that the line isn’t perfect. Obviously the refs aren’t looking at the spot of the ball vs the line, and are comparing it with the actual marker. Fans should just be more aware or acceptant of the fact that they’re wrong sometimes. I’m not saying it was 100% clear that he got it, but considering things it was damn close other way. My point is that that is a completely reasonable, rational statement about the event and anyone reacting negatively isn’t gonna listen to logic or reason, they just wanna be upset right now."

The technology is probably there to get the line to perfectly display where the operator inputs, but there is no guarantee the line is calibrated to where the marker is.  It will be rounded to the nearest yard, usually, but the chains and pylons are not necessarily so.

One thing they could do would be to make it so the official markers are placed with a laser rangefinder so that instead of inputting a best guess manually, the distance is determined from the actual marker.  That would make it much better.

Ideally the ""official"" marker would report a number that the second maker could coordinate against as well, since not only are you seeing the unofficial line, but you're seeing it projected from the unofficial marker.

Fuck it, put a laser grid across the way so you can see the dots on the players as they cross.  But that might run a risk of harming player vision."

Not to mention there's 24 footballs used each game, with 16 games, two sensors for each ball (say one sensor at each tip), that's 768 sensors. You want something quality while usable, and has to be manufactured into the ball and be lightweight enough not to throw off its balance and affect throws, so let's say about $1,000 per sensor. That's $768,000 invested in just supplying a single weekend of football. That's not including the signal receivers placed throughout the field and the proprietary software to monitor it, as well as the personnel to operate it.

(Speaking from technological ignorance) it seems like the broadcaster could use some sort of tech to calibrate to the exact yard line (at least to the nearest 1/10th of a yard) for fans to see. 

Doesn’t necessarily need to be for official replay use but through all the college and nfl games I’ve watched over the past month it seems like the yellow line has wide margin of error (up to a half a yard officially if it rounds up) which can be confusing.

Though I will say part of it was a decent plan that was a bit too cautious and failed terribly in the first half -- they kept running 2-3 routes with 6 blockers for 4 rushers, and no one got open.

He has also won so much (though most of it with Russell Wilson and/or an all-time roster), and it's simply hard to find a head coach. His aversion to risk/obsession with running has always been an issue but it got way worse as time went along -- Big Balls Pete is so far gone. Terrible hires throughout Cable to Norton Jr., not good at self-scouting, not a single passable offensive line in his entire time here. I would be completely fine with him if only he changed his risk averse ways and bought into analytics/let Russ cook.

Though in the end considering he has part GM duties, and the ownership situation is murky with Paul Allen's death, he is pretty much never ever getting fired. Either resigns or retires."

Than who ever put that claim together doesn't understand statistics b/c the team that had the biggest penalty differential in 2019 was Indianapolis followed by Miami than Cincinnati. 

Green bay was #5 for  net beneficial yards and #17 for net beneficial penalties, and for total beneficiary penalties they are #24. 

In fact GB is -1 for penalty call differential, behind 16 other teams. So if the Packers are ""the recipients of more friendly calls than any other team"" why does literally no stats actually show that. They don't get the most yards, they don't get the most calls, hell they are net negative on number of calls yet somehow get the more friendly calls than any other team? 

Just to show its not some single year anomaly here are the Packers ratings for the last 8 years for Penalty Differentials and Total Penalties (#1 team would have the greatest disparity in their favor #32 would have the worst)





Foo | Bar | text | text
---|---|----|----
Year | Net Yardage | Net Penalties | Total Beneficial Penalties |
2019 | 5th | 17th | 24th
2018 | 28th | 25th | 27th
2017 | 12th | 19th | 31st
2016 | 5th | 12th | 10th
2015 | 7th| 9th | 4th
2014| 5th| 10th | 8th
2013 | 11th | 12th | 19th
2012 | 7th | 5th | 2nd






If you want to pick the team that gets the most friendly calls its Indy. Over the same time period they have finished #1 four times. GB on average is 10th for net beneficial yardage, and 14th for net beneficial penalties and 16th for total beneficial calls. In what world is 10th, 14th, and 16th getting the most calls in their favor? 

In fact GB is 16th for calls in their favor (other team being penalized) so they are pretty much the epitome of average over the last 8 years, over the last 3 years they have been on of the teams that gets the fewest benefical calls (24th, 27th, and 31st). 

TL;DR - no stats actually support such a claim and GB hasn't been #1 in any beneficial measure of penalties an any season for the last 8 years.

A lot of fans also figured this was a good strategy since the rams window would be closing around that time, and they looked pretty dominant last year so it wouldn’t be as smart to go all in during their open window). Most analysts had us going in the 7-9 to 9-7 range based on our inexperience (which I have a tough time seeing us go below 9-7 as long as Russ is healthy). I’m generally pretty optimistic and I thought best case scenario was 11-5 but I never thought that late in the season we would have a shot at 13-3 and the 1 seed if we didn’t collapse against the cardinals. We definitely caught the injury bug late in the year which didn’t help, but we have a TON of draft capital next year (and cap space) and a lot of rookies saw significant playing time this season and will have another year under their belt. Some of our 2nd and 3rd year players took significant steps forward this year too. This year wasn’t meant to be our year but we performed beyond expectations anyways, so I can’t say I’m too upset with the outcome.

Began seriously watching football (redzone) in college with buddies and gravitated towards the Jets thanks to that 2009 Rex Ryan led squad with Revis Island. Growing up, it was rare to see a Seahawks fan in public. There were no car decals, no jerseys being worn, no fandom. I remember the first wave of bandwagon fans occurred in 2005 during their playoff run and died immediately after they lost the Super Bowl. Then the next wave occurred thanks to beastquake but that fizzled out after they got knocked out of the playoffs. Seahawks were always a joke to the locals, hence the quick rise and fall of bandwagons. I guarantee that nobody laughed harder than people in WA at the Seahawks losing after Hasselbeck’s infamous “we want the ball and we’re gonna score” coin toss. The third bandwagon was 1000x greater than any before. It was an overnight thing where there is zero public display of fandom then you wake up the next day and it’s as if Seahawks jerseys, car decals, business window stickers, flags, etc got puked all over the state. Those who used to shit on and laugh at the Seahawks were all of a sudden life long fans even though none of them knew who Tatupu or Shaun Alexander were. There was Seahawks fandom on every car on the road, on every store front and every house. But the absolutely worst part of that bandwagon was the arrogance the fans developed.

I don’t think there is a week that’s goes by good or bad that I don’t wear any of my favorite sport team jerseys. 


Every team has band wagon fans, it’s gonna be escalated when out of local. IE: growing up in WA I saw Seahawks stuff my whole life, even when they were sub .500. As I am sure CA is the same for 49ers. To argue otherwise is pretty ignorant. I am sure Seattle jerseys are more prominent the last 10 years out of town than ever, but that doesn’t mean every fan is a bandwagon fan, Seattle was still selling out when they were a shit team. Seattle has always had a strong fan base, other bases just didn’t notice til Seattle started winning. 

I remember a day growing up Raiders gear was pretty prominent in WA because of the rivalry, then the divisions changed and Raiders gear all but disappeared from WA overnight. It’s the nature of sports. 


I have been a Washington Capitals (hockey fan) for years and would wear my jerseys all the time, at school, work, and local hockey games.

I think with chirped radio signals you might get to a few cm of accuracy depending on how you do the phase unwrapping?  
  
If you can figure out the measurements part of it though you can give the refs clickers that they can hit when they see the carrier down. And have software look up the position of the ball at the time. Everything else stays the same in terms of determining which ref has the spot.

The reality is it was too close to overturn the 1st down call because there’s not a clear angle that shows he was short. The tweet I previously shared (which is posted in the replies to the Barstool tweet of the same pic you shared) is literally the best we’ve got (because it’s based on the *official* red marker, not the yellow line). If you’ve got anything better, go ahead and provide it.

Edit: I would like to point out your original tweet said “refs can’t help but decide the outcome” and then pointed to this play specifically. So yes, it *is like* you’re saying this call decided the outcome of the game."

It could be the difference between a sheet of paper making it in between the tip of the ball and the markers.

You could lose or win a game on a spot because instead of looking at where it was you made an estimation of its position.

Theres a difference between seeing something and making a bad decision with it and just not seeing it and making the decision still."

Do I think he intended to go helmet to helmet? Eh, idk but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt on that.

In doing this, he should have been punished and is certainly at fault for the helmet to helmet."

Is second all time in qb rating.  His stats are absolutely hall of fame level it would depend on his method of leaving tbh.  In terms of retiring he probably needs 2 more years but if he was to get a career ending injury or medical scare now I think he would be in.

If the ball isn't in his helmet, then the ball is clearly before the line to gain unless, again, you can honestly tell me that the marker is obscured by anything other than the colour yellow.

Or do you want to post more pictures of from the back angle to try to make it less certain again.

There's an angle that shows front on, and has the exact line to gain (as exact as possible in the nfl). It's blurry, but that blur doesn't make skin and leather turn yellow, so it's pretty clear to me.

So I'll say it again, do you look at that frame and say that the orange marker is blocked by anything that isn't yellow?"
