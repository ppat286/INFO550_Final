However, while the game was great, the production was an absolute fucking embarassment.

Then the refs royally screw up the spot on 3rd down resulting in the punter spiking it with the unexpected first down. After all this, Booger recommends they run it on 3rd and 10 with 15 seconds left and no timeouts and then spike it on 4th (to lose?). This is definitely the preseason, yes?"

But starting off with the trick play td and going into halftime 16-0.

Then stop em on 4th down and send it to OT.

But that OT was just straight brutal to watch. The most infuriating thing in football not involving officials to me is giving up a 3rd and long in the manner that Buffy gave it up.

3rd and fucking what, 18? And the fucking checkdown gets a first down. It is just completely unacceptable. Seeing 3 Bills players running past the line of gain instead of digging their heels in at the line, when Watson isn't even looking downfield anymore, it's just pathetic man. Just a horrible way to keep the drive going.

And then obviously the big play of the game, not sacking Watson. The first guy I can understand. But I don't understand how the second guy just pinballed off him without even trying to make a tackle.

And those **announcers are clowns**. Can't believe it's the same crew this year for espn. Booger saying to run a draw play and spike the ball when it's fucking 3rd down LOL. And then all 3, including the god damn officiating expert, make 0 mention of Cole Beasley not having his knee down and being airborn when he was touched on that 1st down call.

Singletary is immune to being tackled on the first hit. He is so good.

Fire BOB

Watson is a superstar that still needs a game plan to play to his strengths, I hope we wake the fuck up before the third quarter next week. 

JJ looked pretty decent in return. They still mentioned him way too much. 

I think the Bills are gonna win the AFC east next year.

Second, I cant believe I'm gonna say this because it doesnt make sense but Bill O'Brien outcouched McDermott in this game. McDermott decided to punt late in the game from around the 40, which resulted in a touchback, which is a complete loser call. Then on 4th and 27 instead of trying to kick a long but not impossible field goal, or just punt and pin Houston deep with all your timeouts, they try to go for it? The fuck were they thinking? That was a horrible sequence of events.

Third, poor execution overall from the Bills outside of the first drive of the game. Every chance they had at a big play, they didnt execute. Allen throws a dime in the end zone to Williams, he drops it. Throws a deep one in the red zone to jon brown, he inexplicably jumps to catch it and lands out of bounds. Allen avoids a sack? He just drops the ball. In field goal range? Takes a huge intentional grounding. 4th and forever? Runs straight back and takes a sack without throwing it. Chance at a big sack to get the ball back in overtime? Dont wrap up and let Watson escape and make miracle play to lose the game. It was just consistent failure by the Bills to make play after play. The only player that executed consistently was Hauscha.

Good job by houston remaining composed after a dreadful first half, but I really feel like Buffalo lost that game more than Houston won it.

Lastly, the nfl really needs to look closer at the blindside block rule. I get the point of it, but in this instance, what is the lineman supposed to do? Just give up a sack? He made the right football play, didnt hit in the helmet, didnt do anything malicious. That was terrible."

ALSO, you HAVE to kneel to give yourself up.  It‚Äôs in the rules!   That was also a TD.   Nowhere does it say you can just look at the ref and throw the ball on the ground as common sense...

‚ÄúKickoffs ‚Äî

In American football -- especially at the college and professional levels -- the player executing the kickoff often kicks the ball into the opponent's end zone. If the returner catches it, he can either attempt to run the ball out of the end zone or kneel down and give himself up. If he kneels, it is a touchback, and his team gets the ball at their 20 yard line. He can also let the ball go through the end zone. Once the ball goes out of bounds in the end zone, it is a touchback.‚Äù"

He's a great young quarterback but that was crazy. It was like he was playing madden thinking he could create a legendary play by doing the most rediculous thing possible. He'll grow outta it though it was so obvious just young and under pressure of playoffs.

Has nothing to do with if someone sees you or not. You‚Äôre not allowed to block past parallel towards your own goal line."

2572,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd6b805')>,fd6b805,-1,1578217119.0,"I‚Äôm not so sure he was short of the first down. His knee may not have hit the turf. When looking at both angles, it looked like his knee didn‚Äôt actually touch the ground. I assumed it did initially and thought he was short, but if the knee didn‚Äôt touch, then he pretty clearly got the first. I think this is why the play stood as called. The terrible execution of 4th down was the problem here not the refs. If the Bills execute like a winning team this review doesn‚Äôt become an issue. 

The blindside block is also not on the refs. They called the rule as it was intended (sadly).

The delay of game is an obvious error that warrants correction.

Holding is something that literally occurs on every play. Depending on how egregious it is, I would probably shelf that complaint."

Buffalo (as a fan, Im sure you know) has a very good defense so McDermott trusts his defense to play well and not let Houston gain a lot of yards, giving Buffalo's offense better field position. With better field position, the offense doesnt have to gain as many yards to get into scoring range. As you know, Buffalo doesnt have the strongest offense so playing the field position game, is their best bet of winning.

An edge rusher is pushed into a QB resulting in them falling into their legs common sense=no penalty, reality 15 yards and a free field goal attempt. It's not Houston's fault and 2 points may not have changed the outcome ( you guys were in field goal range with that last 4th and 1 you went for so you may have won it there) but as an NFL fan it seems now games are being tweaked and tinkered with by refs.

Normally you can block by diving at someone, but usually when you're blocking while running back towards your goal-line, you have some momentum and the defender isn't looking, so a low-impact block of just lightly pushing the guy would almost always be enough to take him out of the play.  That's the idea behind the rule at least.

In this case, he did hit him with his shoulder.  It is a penalty even though he didn't really try to make it an overly violent hit.  Maybe the rule would be better if it allowed more discretion, but as written it's always a no-no to lead with anything other than your arms there."

Beasley caught the pass and went down sliding on a knee.  The game is still live, because in the NFL that is not enough for a player to be down.

Beasley makes a move that has him diving part the first down marker.  While in the air, he is touched by an opponent.  This makes it so that when he lands, he is down

The crack ESPN announcing team was trying to convince people that he was down when he was first touched.  Which is wrong."

Add in trying to guess motive of the player to plays and you're just going to muddy the waters further. It's a game of inches played by professionals on the highest stage of the sport. The players should live up to that level of play, or what's the point?"

It's not. 

- ""falling to the ground, or kneeling, and clearly making no immediate effort to advance.""

The operative word here is ""and"" indicating you have to do both. Falling to the ground while making a catch for example doesn't meet the standards here. Coincidentally, the same reason is why when the Bills had an interception earlier in the year towards the end of the game, and ran into the endzone after it, it wasn't considered a safety. He had fallen to the ground, no one bothered to touch him, and he clearly was making no effort to advance the ball.

Consider this issue: There are clearly established norms for kickoffs. Do you not want to catch the ball? Let it go out of bounds. Do you want to not run it out? That's what the fair catch signal is for. Do you want to do the same thing, but inside the endzone? That's what taking a knee is for, although fair catch signal in the endzone also works. Why would you randomly decide to do NONE of those things? I mean the ref actually backed away from it and unless I'm mistaken didn't blow the play dead. None of them knew what the fuck he was doing either. This should be an indicator to everyone that this is not normal behavior that conforms to the rule.

He only met half the criteria for the ball to be considered dead. Giving your blockers a signal isn't part of the rule. It was a 100% blown call."

If you think the rules should be changed that's fine, but changing the rules during the game is a bad way to go about it. Arguing Common Sense or intent is for courts of law and not for the field of play.

Let me be clear here. We didn't lose because of this. There was a whole lot more game played after that happened. We lost because of by the Texans adjusting, Allen playing poorly, and a ticky tacky Blind Side block that pushed us out of field goal range."

And you're ignoring the practical result of the call: we got one of the most intense playoff games of all time, with incredible feats of athleticism and skill on both sides of the field.

If you had your way, we wouldn't have had that.  We would have had the game determined on a bullshit technicality.  Your team would advance, but it would have been worse for fans everywhere and worse for the game of football overall.

3976,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd6hnx1')>,fd6hnx1,2,1578219969.0,Idrc I do definitely feel like the 50/50 on ref calls was more a 40/60 today
3977,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd6i3k9')>,fd6i3k9,0,1578220171.0,Nah honestly the refs called a balanced game. Bills just completely shot them selves in the foot and handed the game away on a silver platter. Just so many stupid decisions from their QB and coaches cost them the game.
3978,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd6m5fo')>,fd6m5fo,2,1578221798.0,Do you really think that the helmet to helmet should have been a no call?
3979,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd6mga2')>,fd6mga2,1,1578221905.0,Yes and no. Allen was taking a lot of big hits. You get some calls you don‚Äôt get others
3980,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd6o3bj')>,fd6o3bj,2,1578222461.0,I don't think he got any calls from hits though
3981,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd6oclz')>,fd6oclz,1,1578222552.0,Because he was hardly gave him self up. Dude was running threw people like a tank and is deemed as a runner so they can‚Äôt protect him when he does
3982,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd6oifb')>,fd6oifb,2,1578222611.0,But you can't hit someone helmet to helmet even when they're a runner
3983,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fd6ouck')>,fd6ouck,1,1578222732.0,He wasn‚Äôt being hit helmet to helmet every play he ran. He lowers his shoulder so does the defender. He doesn‚Äôt protect himself
