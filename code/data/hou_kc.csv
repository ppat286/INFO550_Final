Granted, teams like the Bears and the Rams are in way more desperate ""win now"" scenarios, but I don't see how you're fixing this defense when you have no draft capital.

115,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fe6i3qj')>,fe6i3qj,8,1578920399.0,"This was an insane game. We definitely learned a few things from it. Here’s some takeaways

1) Bill O’Brien is holding the Texans back. Some coaches are great in the regular season, but can’t get their team past that point. Marvin Lewis was awesome for the Bengals, but he suffered from this issue. Bill has a better QB than Marvin, which helps, but he has proven thus far he doesn’t know how to utilize him fully. The Texans could use an upgrade at HC. 

2) Mahomes is the best QB in the NFL. This wasn’t as much of a debate, but today confirmed it. Mahomes makes high difficulty throws look easy. The guy can use his legs when he has to, and he uses them very well. The Chiefs will have the best QB in the league for the next decade or so. They will have multiple rings if they can maintain an average defense.

3) Andy Reid is under appreciated. I know he struggles in the playoffs, but he truly is an all time great coach. He’s without a doubt the second best coach in the NFL right now. He’s a great guy as well. He deserves a ring, and this team might just get that ring for him. 

4) The Chiefs offense, when it’s hot, can’t be stopped. Whenever the Chiefs get on a roll, good luck. If they can play to their full potential next week, there is no doubt that Mahomes and the gang will head into Miami as Super Bowl favorites. For the sake of the NFL I hope that they win. They are easily the most exciting team remaining."

You get a field goal, but then the other team scores. You do a fake punt in your territory next drive on 4TH and 4 and don’t make it, enemy team scores. Then you fumble a kickoff, other team scores, and now the game is a 3 point difference, 24-21. Then you punt, don’t do anything on offense, and then have your defense get stomped because they can’t cover a tight end. Then let them get a touchdown. Next drive, you get a good pass and a good run to get to field goal position, yet not good enough and you unluckily miss the field goal.

In the span of about 10 minutes.

The second half starts. Momentum has shifted but hey, new half new you new team, you can play better. What’s that? You don’t want to? Okay then, the enemy team gets a 48-yard pass, and then they score a touchdown. But look on the bright side, they miss the extra points and you’re only down by 10, you get some extra yardage because of a flag on the kickoff, now you’re offense takes the field. Andddddd you punt the ball. Let’s hope you’re defense shows up. Nope, you can’t cover the tight end who has been crushing you all game and they score a touchdown. Now you’re feeling defeated, you’re in the playoffs you gotta keep playing so you aren’t that embarrassed. You also have a chance, if they can do it   you can to right? No fake out here-you guys score a touchdown. 31-41.

All in the span of 15 minutes.

Last quarter comes, only down by 10, then some big plays for the enemy happen. Other team scores again. Now you really need to pop off, and but offense doesn’t make the 4th down. Opposite team scores (only a field goal tho) and the defense has given up. Offense takes ball, and they get stopped on 4th down in enemy territory. Defense stops the opposing team, and next drive you don’t make the 4th and goal again. I’m afraid the damage is done, and you head into the locker rooms defeated, as you lose the game 31-51.

All in the span of 60 minutes.

Lol (I think everything that could’ve went wrong for the Texans went wrong, some were unlucky and others were just bad play.)

Seriously feel bad for you Texans fans. Yet you guys had a good season and will most likely be better next season. Roster will improve, Watson will be ready next time, coaching will hopefully get better.

Okay, I'm not shocked we got blasted...but I just have to vent here.

Last night, I felt the Ravens made a bad decision by going for it on that 4th down, but I respect that they've been aggressive the whole year and that's what they do. So if BoB didn't make the decision to go for it on the Chiefs territory **ON A 4TH AMD 1**, why in the fuck would he go for a fake punt **ON A 4TH AND 3 FROM YOURE OWN TERRITORY?**. It makes no fucking sense.

Look, no one picked us to win and we were underdogs, so if you would have went for the first one I would have understood that we're playing with nothing to lose and cool, let's be aggressive, but kicking the field goal is saying g that you're fine with the lead and we want to play the possession game...cool...but that fake punt made no sense.

Unfortunately BoB will continue to be our coach and we will continue to be mediocre and fans are just fine with that but I'm not mann...I just can't. I've seen us waste Andre Johnson, we wasted Prime Watt and we're going to waste Watson and Hopkins and I just can't do it anymore mann.

Fire BOB.

Mahomes is just so damn good and I love him. If he plays like that next week, there's no way the Tits keep up.

The Texans choked the game away but it's not on Watson at all. He had a good to great game. No turnovers and good yardage and only 2 sacks were his fault really. A game like this should be a win. 

If you don't fire BOB, atleast fire RAC, you can't give up 40+ points in a row in a playoff game and keep your DC job.

Fire BOB. 

This draft should be nothing but Defense and maybe some line depth for the Texans. 

The trades the Texans made were still worth it entirely.

Not sure why so many comments talking about going for a FG as a bad call. They scored 51 on us. It would not have mattered. You can point to the fake punt but again, our D could not stop them. We just had to hope they would drop passes.

I dont want to fire OB because I dont feel like this loss is totally on him. Our defense has been garbage all year thanks in part due to injuries and our offense did pretty good. Mahomes is just insane and we didnt have the personnel to play man against the chiefs. You can point to poor game management and I dont disagree but even if we make those first downs mahomes is still gonna shred us. We basically had a ragtag secondary most of the year and had to pick up bums like Hargreaves who literally got dropped from the 32nd ranked pass D only for us to pick him up.

Future isnt looking totally bleak like some are saying. Tunsil and Stills have been worth the trades. We just need a pass defense that isnt utter garbage or ravaged by injuries and we are competitive. The main issues will be paying everyone moving forward."

Thats Texans football. We looked so slow on defense. JJ looks like he boutta retire, and I think he might. We have many talented players but we just don't have that edge to get over the hump.

I dont even care about the 24 pt lead. I do care about letting them put up 50 in 3 qtrs. Wheres the pass rush? Wheres the defensive scheme to slow them? Every drive was like a 2 minute touchdown.

You could not ask for a more disastrous start if you were a Texans fan.  In the first quarter alone, the chiefs had like 5 drops, all which were first downs or going to be big gains.

Now I dont know how many people in this thread have tried to run full speed while throwing a ball across your body but it isn't just hard. It's unnatural, it requires all body parts to be working towards that effort. It requires hips, it requires your feet to be in the right place to redirect the accuracy and power into the throw. The dude literally had the awareness to adjust an on-the-run-throwing-across-his-body throw and remain behind the LOS by adjusting to drag his right foot on the turf just to slow his momentum down and to make his profile as big as possible as to not cross the LOS.

Truly, we can say that it was an accident and that he was just dragging his feet naturally. But I refuse to believe that. He did that shit on purpose. The awareness is absolutely unreal from him."

Rookie deals are extremely valued due to that window where your QB isn't gobbling up a crapton of cap space. Once you pay your QB in their second deal, you have to make a lot of tough decisions in who stays and who is let go.

Look at what happened to the Seahawks when they gave Wilson his second deal. They were forced to dismantle the LOB because there was no cap space left to pay everyone else.

>In the last two seasons, Mahomes has a TD% of 8.68%. However, the league average last year was 4.8%. If you adjust his TD% to 5%, still above LA, he goes from throwing 57 TDs in his last 18 games to only 32.85. I'll be generous and give him 33.

>Now, let's adjust his passer rating. It goes from 116.5 to only 104.3 by just adjusting his TD% to normally above average. Later on, I will adjust it further to take yards into account.

>Next, we have to account for him passing more than league average. He has 657 pass attempts over 18 games. The LA is 35.5/game, which equals 639, around a 2.7% reduction. Mahomes also has a flukey 9.01 Y/A, which can be adjusted to 8 (still above LA) based on the league average of 7.5.

>So we can estimate that over a 16 game season, his adjusted yardage is (6397.5)/1816= 4544 yards.

>Now, I will adjust his passer rating again based on these 16 game stats

>4544 yards

>639 attempts

>426 completions (also adjusted)

>After this, his passer rating bottoms out at 96.66, which lands him squarely between Dak Prescott and Ben Roethlisberger last year.

>His final 16 game adjusted stats:

>4544 yards / 639 ATT / 426 CMP / 66.7% CMP (same) / 33 TD / 12 INT (same) / 8 Y/A / 96.7 RATE
What does this tell us?
It tells us that Mahomes' perceived success in the league is largely inflated by unsustainable, wildly outlier stats in his 18 games as perceived elite talent. When you adjust for the future by bringing down his outlier stats, he regresses heavily to a slightly above average QB of 2018 Dak tierdom."

The real secret is to actually use the power option on your microwave and cook at a lower wattage, and also leave whatever you're cooking in for a bit after it's 'done.' This stops the overcooked outside/frozen inside combo by properly allowing the outside-in cooking process of a microwave to complete instead of just absolutely fucking roasting the outside then taking it out.

Think of it kind of like pan-searing a steak. You don't just drop it onto your scorching hot cast-iron for a minute each side and call it done, that's just the sear, the inside hasn't gotten shit for heat yet, you gotta turn down the heat and finish it up proper now."

Hindsight is 20/20, but it was also 20/20 before hand too. Up until that point, KC had punt 3 straight drives to open the game. 

It was a bad call and I can say this with confidence because it ended with the Chiefs making it a 10 point game instead of starting at their own 20 which could have ended in anything, but either way it would have killed the clock so they wouldn’t have got 28 points in the quarter."

If you have something better please point me to it. A 7.5 point line is a lot of points, meaning the chiefs are decently heavy favorites. I wouldn’t bet the line... I could see this game playing out one of two ways:

1) The titans take a lead or at least keep it close. They run the ball and chew clock, keeping the ball out of Mahomes hands. In this scenario the titans don’t necessarily win, but they likely cover. 

2) The chiefs get a lead and the titans have to abandon the run. If this happens, I could see the game not being particularly close and I think the chiefs would cover."

Just imagine this offense if we had Hunt(sans the fighting women, and apparently everyone he encounters while drunk.) this offense is so good, and we should have a league leading rusher, who could make something out of nothing in the backfield.

That being said fuck Kareem Hunt.  He was good at football, and pretty shitty at the rest of life.  I hope we get a ring and he has to set on a losing Browns bench knowing that he could have been here, yet in fuckinging the team over, he fu ked himself much harder.  Asshole karma!"

Tyreek claimed his GF left his house untouched and came back with bruises then called the cops on him. So the fact that Tyreek is the one that gave her those bruises is heresay. And I believe pleading guilty allowed him to transfer and play football at a smaller school, something he wouldn't have been able to do if he went to trial and was found guilty.

At the end of the day, there's video evidence of one, and two conflicting stories about the other.

And you're correct. I know it's common for children to be taken during one of these investigations but after some looking around it's not 100% of the time. 

You're missing the point entirely though... I'm not saying Tyreek is innocent. I'm saying I don't know 100% either way. What I do know is I watched a video with my own eyes where Joe Mixon followed a chick into a Pickleman's, kept harassing her, and then knocked her the fuck out.

The entire point here is don't throw stones when you live in a glass house. Get off your high horse acting like the Chiefs are some awful organization while you cheer for a team with players who do this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5wIj7LbslY

Our \_only\_ chance to win is if we can keep our offense on the field, chew clock, and consistently score points (FG or TD)."" 

That is precisely what happened. You can absolutely blame OB for not having the team ready or able enough to beat KC, not being able to stop their offense in the first place, etc. But I think going all in on trying to keep the offense on the field was valid. They stood no chance in the game of field position (e.g. punting), but did have a shot if they could keep scoring. It was a high risk, low reward decision, but the only valid one that would lead them to a win."

Lets say you and I are playing blackjack but I get to go second unlike in a casino I'm not forced to keeping hitting until I reach 17. I get to watch what total you get to, lets say you reach 19, and if I get to 18 screw it, I'm still going to hit because 18 loses to 19. That gives me a massive advantage.

OT works the same way. The second team to go knows what they need to do and can make crucial decisions appropriately. This is a tangible advantage that may be subtle, but you can find examples from games where teams made a unusual call because they knew they had to do so. I'm not saying second team has the overall advantage in the average game, but there is a balance in play between an advantage to go first and an advantage to go second.

Please don't try to tell me why my opinions are they way they are. As I said before, I've liked the OT rules ever since they changed them, long before we won a couple OT games. I don't want a shootout rule because I think it would be lame to decide a championship. 

Let me ask you why do you think the current rules favor the Patriots? If the Chiefs had won that coin toss instead of Pats, with their high powered offence they very well may have had the ""huge"" advantage you claim from going first. There's really no way to make an overtime period to favor a certain team since it still comes down to a coin toss for who gets to decide."
