Wentz misses the 2017 and 2018 playoffs with injuries.  He closes out this season with practice squad players to get us into the post-season only to be knocked out in the first quarter.  As far as the hit goes - some were saying there was no intent // it wasn't a dirty hit.  I disagree.  [I may be biased, but this seems like head-hunting](https://mobile.twitter.com/summatime06/status/1213947430422495233?s=19).

Either way - this was a tough loss, but I am glad there were at least no *other* injuries in this game."

Because it can't be such a clear and obvious penalty that the refs and broadcast missed, but also only obvious from specific camera angle on one specific slow-mo replay.

I‚Äôm not sure there is many players in the league who wouldn‚Äôt be concussed after that hit.

442,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fdcd953')>,fdcd953,3,1578300881.0,"My thoughts:

* Obviously, Wentz going down changed everything. I hope it¬¥s nothing serious and Eagles bounces back next season. Bird bros.
* Clowney should¬¥ve been rejected from the game, but aside from that horrific hit, he actually played very well and was disruptive until Eagles realized he was our only pass-rusher and decided to double and tripple team him towards the end.
* We got seven sacks, but yet I still feel our D-line underperfomed big time, it is also worth noting that Mccown at least escaped 2-3 additional sacks. Our open field tackling was bad.
* This game also shows that even with Diggs in, what really matters is getting our pass rush going. If you cannot rush the passer, then nothing else really matters unless your secondary is great.
* Tre Flowers had a tough game
* Cody Barton actually played very well, in my opinion. Two passes defended and one sack. He is coming along really nicely and turning out to be a valuable pick for us, in terms of coverage he¬¥s a clear upgrade from Kendricks.
* Putting up 17 points (should¬¥ve been 20 for that blocked FG) without our starting LT, LG and C and against that helacious D-line (I know their secondary is piss poor) is not bad. Russ played very well under those circumstances.
* Metcalf really came back with a vengance after his poor performance last time in Philly.
* People myself included might be extra tough on our defense, but at the end of the day they allowed 9 points and had two huge fourth down stances. So they also deserve some respect, even though it was against a back-up QB.
* Packers should be heavy favorites, but with Lupati and Brown hopefully being back, our offense should be more efficient."

Eagles fans should be disappointed by the bad injury luck and other frustrations of this year, but they should also be very happy with how well their team handled the hand they were dealt. You made a big investment in Wentz and while the results weren't always pretty, he played pretty well in awful situations. This isn't a ""y'all gonna be 5p00ky next year,"" because there are some obvious deficiencies they have to figure out and upgrade and I hope they don't, but Pederson is clearly a great coach who can at times elevate a shitshow situation into something respectable, and we know he can win a Super Bowl too.

Both the Cowboys and Eagles regressed and underachieved, but one of those teams had every reason to and showed it knows how to do more with what it's got. So Eagles fans have every reason to feel like the ship is in good hands and the reasons for sputtering was good.

And then he goes down on the second drive, not due to any fault of his own, but due to an unpenalized dirty hit. Like I know we had a slim chance of winning this game even with Wentz but I just want to watch my team play dude.

It‚Äôs also ignorant to disregard the difference in preparation Wentz and McCown must have had for this game. I guarantee Wentz is taking significantly more practice snaps with the starting WRs than McCown, and the playbook for the week is designed with Wentz‚Äòs out-of-pocket capabilities in mind rather than McCown‚Äôs. Like even if in a vacuum (somehow) Wentz is a worse QB than a 40-year-old Josh McCown, it‚Äôs ridiculous to claim that somehow we are better off for having wentz injured. Even BIGOLAS DICKOLAS NICOLAS during the Super Bowl year played like shit for a few weeks before he adjusted to the system and before the system adjusted to him. In this case, scheming for a mobile quarterback who seems to be most comfortable outside of the pocket and then having to play with a career pocket passer is a recipe for disaster.

The Titans upsetting the Patriots was karmic with Mike Vrabel pretty much using Belichick moves on Belichick.  Watching Logan Ryan intercept the remainder of Tom Brady's career was poetic.

Vikings vs Saints was another shocking overtime game that ended in a way no one expected. The Saints looked like a favorite to represent the NFC in the superbowl and were stunned by the #6 seed.  Kirk Cousins showed everyone he deserves to be starting in the NFL.  Turned out to be way closer than anyone expected.

Then there was the Seahawks vs the Eagles.  Everyone expected the Seahawks to win.  Wentz went out early, so everyone was robbed of seeing the NFC East champions at their best.  Then the Seahawks just won.  Carroll didn't do anything fancy or exciting.  It was just game management to take us to the predictable ending.  Compared to the other 3, this one was a snoozefest."

FPI prediction: PHI, 60.3% (by an average of 3.4 points)  

Second result, NYTimes:  
Pick: Seahawks -1.5  

Third result, a site called Athlon Sports:  
It's a picture so can't post it, but all three took the Seahawks.  

Fourth result was CBSSports:  
It looks like they were giving the Eagles the edge with -1.  Also looks like they wanted you to watch a show to actually get anything useful out of it.

Fifth result was also CBSSports, but it was just the Saints/Vikings game.  

Sixth and Seventh results were both BleacherReport with two different writers (Kristopher Knox and Zach Buckley):  
First took the Eagles, second the Seahawks  

My final result on the first page was Sportsline, and they wanted me to pay to see their predictions from a computer model.

So my first page of google results was 7-3 for the Seahawks, but I'm guessing that you would likely get different results."

With Wentz, the Eagles had the third best red zone offense.  With McCown, the team went 0 for 5.  It's not hard to imagine that Wentz gets one TD.  Especially when you see how the Seahawks played McCown in the red zone.  There were running lanes that McCown wanted to take.  

Obviously, the Seahawks would probably not have those running lanes for Wentz, but that would have taken players from somewhere else.  With McCown, leaving a large portion of the field was not nearly the same liability."

They don't have an absurdly talented roster, they have a question mark at QB (i like Wentz, but still a question mark), a great O and D line, and like 2/3 of a wide receiver, turnstile of free agents at RB, and an elite TE. The cowboys have a much more talented roster, were healthy, and still lost the division."

Back when I first started, I used to play on three teams per week, and at least two of those nights I'd stay for a few hours after my game playing pickup ball. And I'd wish I had time to play more. 

Now I play just one night per week, and after a single hour or so match at least one of my ankles always hurts, my hitting shoulder always hurts, and I'm usually pretty darn tired. And there's lots of nagging aches and pains that seemingly never go away or fully heal. I used to be bummed by the off-season, but now I look forwards to it as a chance to recover some. And outside of volleyball, I'm actually spending more time exercising and trying to stay healthy than I did in my youth. It's like I do that exercising not to improve my body anymore, but just to slow down the decline. 

Getting older is weird. Mentally I don't feel that old. It feels like the past twenty years went by so fast, I still have no idea what the hell is going on ever. But my body is undeniably on a downwards slide. I still hope to live for another 40+ years, but at the same time I'm kind of terrified what kind of shape my body will be in by then, even if I stay relatively healthy."

The other issue is the way Pete plays close games leaves zero room for error at the end of games. Russ has to be perfect or we lose. How about cutting him loose before the 4th quarter. His 4th q stats aren't so much better than 1 through 3 because he's not as good outside the 4th q. It's because Pete wants to run first and will do that until he has absolutely no option.

belichick isn't on the verge of missing the playoffs every year. pederson's record as a head coach:

* 7-9


the last time belichick had single digit wins was 2002. belichick also typically has FAR less talent to work with on the roster than pederson does.

The red zone offense is really the only thing that was keeping the Eagles afloat most the season.  It wasn't until the last few weeks where the Eagles were getting decent success between the 20s.

I will say that the fact that the call was missed adds to the infamy of the play. The play itself is a bad look for Clowney, but the fact that he ""got away with it"" just takes it to another level for fans. We all know, because it's happened to every fan base. [This happened to Russ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD0mc2lFaQ4) a few years back and I was furious, I get it.

the Crown of the helmet rule was introduced during that season in which Clowney hit Foles near the endzone, and there was so much inconsistency and controversy in how it was called that year. It was officiated so poorly, and it rarely gets called anymore. 

I'm not going to call a guy a dirty player for getting the majority of the tackle correct and within the guidelines of the rules. If he lowered his head seconds after the ball was thrown and drove the QB to the ground, that's a dirty play. You could *see* Clowney check for the ball location before tackling and then pull up after hitting him, that's not a dirty player. 

That facemask play was not ok, but these other plays don't scream out dirty player like a Ndamukong Suh or Vontaze Burfict."

This was common place among D linemen hitting QBs until the rule change happened last year (which they have mysteriously stopped calling). LBs and CBs still do this to receivers across the middle- it only gets called if it‚Äôs towards the head.

I understand the face mask but I just can‚Äôt agree with all three of those plays being ‚Äúegregiously illegal/dangerous.‚Äù Football is dangerous.

The salt come from the fact you are bringing up games that had already happened *still not involving you* in a game thread that doesnt involve you."

Also you're the one that dreamed alcohol into this scenario. Nice and sober today. Wouldn't blame you for being drunk though what with having to live in Philly. Try again ;)

Its moving so fast and theres so little time to react that I'm not going to immediately call him and the team the dirtiest thing in pro sports like the rest of this reactionary sub.

Good thing I don't.  Not even close.

I only lol'd at a Seattle fan with the audacity to call another city besides Portland or San Francisco ""trash"".

> Lmao you're so mad your shitty team

Less time has passed since 2/4/18 than will pass before Seattle gets a hockey team.

How about you grow the fuck up and admit that those kinds of hits are bad for the players, bad for the league and the kind of sick violence that this game no longer needs for fans to enjoy tuning in. It ruined the game and EVERYONE said it was boring watching your dirty ass team barely beat a geriatric and a bunch of high school kids.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a part of the game. However, I don‚Äôt think anything I said indicates one way or the other, except that eagles fans are so fucking salty that anything short of him ‚Äúthrowing rocks at his helmet until he had to leave the game on a stretcher‚Äù is believing it‚Äôs fair game. It was a shitty play. If it had been called targeting, nobody would have blinked and Wentz would still have been out of the game. Did the Seahawks play with intent to injure though? Give me a break."

You‚Äôre spinning bullshit because you somehow think I was saying the Hawks came out with intent to injure when what I‚Äôve said this entire thread is that it was Clowney. I genuinely am lost as to how you think I meant the Hawks as a whole because I haven‚Äôt said that the entire thread."
