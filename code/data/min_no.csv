  Seem more Erratici than our Giants teams but maybe this win and those losses against GB and Seahawks will push you to be the best.

  Big key is if defense can play like today. Defense for you seems alright but today played pretty well. I know your defense was great two years ago and you have good players so they should be able to take down anyone in this NFC. Lastly comes down to your offense making the tough plays. Cousins came up big in the clutch in OT. My concern is can your offense be consistent. You made some dumbass plays calls and notice your offense can really halt. If you can just make those big plays you can beat nay team in the NFC and even AFC. One thing you have is that experience outside maybe Cousins as your QB.

The Saints Def could have protected a 24-20 score, easily, with all that momentum.

Fucking gutless to try so hard to not hustle, to not keep the fire in your offense's heart, and cost them what was probably the best chance to take the lead and put it the game in a defense that was stuffing the shit out of the Vikes...

I did not expect the Vikings pass rush to get past that great Saints Oline.

I did not expect Thielen and Cook to play so well because of their injuries.

I cannot understand why the Saints were not willing to throw the ball more.  Yes the Vikes got pressure without blitzing but with the corner injury problems I expected the quick passing game to be very effective for the Saints, and it was...when they used it.  Instead they seemed to stay away from it for much of the game, running the ball or having Brees hold the ball.

Other things I noticed:

* Vikings got way too conservative on offense in the 4th.

* The toss plays were not going to work when the Saints were keying in on the run later in the game.  

* I think everyone was expecting a jump ball to Rudolph on the last play, but somehow he got single coverage anyway"

 Looking at their schedule, they hadn’t really played anyone in the second half of the season but the Niners, which they lost at home.

Their defensive statistics were a complete mirage and they are actually at best middle of the pack. 

Also the offense simply plays at a lower level in the playoffs compared to the regular season. Very similar play during last year’s playoffs.

That said I have a few complaints  
On the game winning TD imo  
1. It was a textbook pushoff and should have been OPI  
2. Based on how they have reviewed PI all year they were consistent with not overturning the call.  
3. The issue is Riveron is a jackass who refuses to properly enforce the rule.  
Also OT rules need to change already. It is crap when teams can get eliminated in OT without touching the ball. Football is the only sport where it is really possible (technically could happen in soccer or hockey but highly unlikely)"

The coin toss should not have that much impact late in a game, ESPECIALLY this late in the season.

And yes, I've seen some BS stats trotted out about win percentages of coin toss winners, but I've never seen them backed up with sample sizes, P-values, timeframes, etc.

The only statistic that should matter is: how often do post-kickoff drives result in a touchdown?  As that number is non-zero, both teams really should have a chance to possess."

You can keep the sudden death. If the first team with possession scores a touchdown on the first drive they win; game over. But if the first team with possession fails to score at all, they lose; game over. That way the only way for the game to continue on is for the first team to score a field goal and then the second team must tie or win.

It may seem unfair. It may be unfair. But statistically it's pretty fair:

>*Under the old rule, when the NFL awarded overtime victories to the first team to score, teams that won the coin toss also won 53.4 percent of regular and postseason overtime games. To reduce the advantage, the NFL changed the rule. Now, 52.7 percent of teams winning the overtime coin toss (and receiving) win the game at some point in overtime.*

Afterwards they added the qualifiers of 'if you score a td on opening possession you win' or 'if you kick a field goal on the oppening posession the other team gets an opportunity'. 

Favre never got to touch the ball, thus the rule was changed.

The issue people suddenly seem to have is that if the team who wins the toss scores a td on the opening drive then that's game over, and that's somehow unfair. Maybe it is, but the only change I'd make is to let the other team have an opportunity to match with their own td. Fail to do that and the game ends there.

The genius is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of spiking on 4th down most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Boogers outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from  ESPN, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just genius - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Booger truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the genius in Booger’s existential catchphrase "" Run a quick draw play” which itself is a cryptic reference to the late Jason Garrett. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Booger’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Booger tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for his eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"

Some folks think college rules are better, where each team is given a possession at the opposing 25-yd line (repeating until 1 team wins.) On the other hand, in that scenario, the team that goes 2nd has a large information advantage because they know whether they’d only need a FG to win, or if they need a TD for example, they can go for it on 4th without hesitation where the team that goes first doesn’t have that luxury. It’s pretty hard to come up with a perfect method."
3564,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fdbr6pp')>,fdbr6pp,1,1578289456.0,"It never has made sense and it shouldn't be hard to fix. They need to play 2 overtime halves. The crux of the problem has always been the fact that they try to solve overtime with ONE overtime period. It MUST be TWO just like there are two halves to the game. The length of the halves could be up for debate but I'd say around 3 minutes each should be sufficient. It doesn't need to be super long BUT it DOES need to be long enough where each team could conceivably get the ball.

You could still flip to see who gets the ball the first half and which direction. There would still theoretically be some advantage to receiving the ball in the second half because that team would know what they need to do to get the lead but with 6 full minutes of playing, each team would have full opportunity to win.

With the current system we are literally allowing a coin flip to decide which team can win the game with a touchdown and not allow the other team's offense to have a chance. For as much time and money is spent in the league, it's criminal that overtime has always been so stupid and flawed."

Bountygate.

Brees taking a ridiculously expensive contract that crowded out the Saints from competing for 3-4 years, and people defending the contract.

Last year's NFC title game.

And those, and i err on this, that think stats are overrated--particularly in an era when its ridiculously easy to complete a forward pass compared to both the dead ball era (pre-79) and the live ball era (79-~03)--and get sick of all the worship of a QB based on stats.  

Where are the road playoff wins?  Where are the conference title games won on the road?  Where are the multiple Super Bowl appearances?  Brees plays in a *dome*, which contributes to his stat accumulation in an era that punishes the defense for trying to defend the pass. 

Is Brees a top 20 QB of all time, possibly top 15?  Sure.  Is he top 10?  No.  He's not above Elway or Staubach, who both won 2 conference title games on the road.  He's certainly not above Montana or Brady.  Peyton Manning--who has a similarly poor road playoff record--at least has four SB appearances, and the noble achievement of being the only QB to win SBs with two different franchises.  Even Favre went to two Superbowls, and Rogers won three straight playoff games on the road, including a conference championship to a franchise the Saints lost to four years prior.  Now Brees has presided over two straight home losses in the playoffs, and made critical mistakes in both.  His stats are dependent on context, not on transcendent ability throughout NFL history.

Enough with the stats uber alles mentality.  QBs in the modern era justifiably deserve more blame for losses than in the past because the whole system caters to them.  If a QB can't win multiple SBs after the 2003 rule changes, then he's not in the discussion for Top 10 QB of all time, no matter what the hollow passing records say.  If Terry Bradshaw--who called his own plays--played in the modern NFL, he would throw for ~4,500 yards every year, completing 65% of his passes, and his gamer abilities would differentiate him from others throwing for ~5,500 a year and 70% of their passes.  God knows what Marino's stats--and SB record--would be if he played from 2003-2020 instead of 1983-2000.  

Enough.  Hype."

4449,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fdbuffu')>,fdbuffu,6,1578290986.0,My proposed OT rules: Offenses and defenses from both teams on the field at the same time. 40 yard lines convert to TD line with 50 being back of endzones. Both teams start at their own 5 yard line. First team to score a TD or safety wins. Non conversion of 4th down means restart at your own 5 yard line.

If you changed it so there's no sudden death, not a single team would accept the football as being able to match your opponent is an advantage.

It's always going to be unfair in some way or another, but (and again, I'm not 100% sure of this) if this way is relatively 50/50 then they should keep it."

4734,<bound method Comment.parent of Comment(id='fdbrhq0')>,fdbrhq0,10,1578289666.0,"What people fail to understand about the OT rules is there is an advantageous side to going second. Yes obviously going first has the advantage of scoring a TD wins you the game, but how often do teams have drives that lead to TDs?

If the game is in OT, and it's not a pure shootout, it's probably less than 50%.

But if you go second, and the first team gets a field goal? Up to the point where you are in field goal range you are in 4 down territory, so you get 25% more chances to continue your drive than the first team did for at least the first half of your drive.

So let's consider this scenario. Let's say a team goes first and goes three and out, punts it away, and loses on a field goal. That sucks, but it's ""fair"" in the eyes of NFL fans.

But let's reverse the situation. Let's say the team that 3 and outs goes second, and the first team gets their field goal. Instead of going 3 and out, they go for it on 4th down, and get their conversion, and they end the drive with a TD, thus winning the game.

In almost all other scenarios in football they would be punting the ball there basically, but because of the nature of the overtime rules, they now go for it, and they win the game because of it.

Was that fair? Getting that extra play which normally would have never happened led to their win. Hardly seems fair to me. But oddly enough, it does seem to balance out with the first TD advantage.

We can never have a perfect system because of the nature of football, and punting it on 4th down vs. going for it, but the one we have now is actually pretty decent, even statistically better than college football."

If you changed it so there's no sudden death, not a single team would accept the football as being able to match your opponent is an advantage.    

It's always going to be unfair in some way or another, but (and again, I'm not 100% sure of this) if this way is relatively 50/50 then they should keep it."

In 2017 they ran into a hot Eagles squad when they were running Sam Bradford and quarterback.  2009 they lost to Drew Brees and Sean Peyton on their hurricane revenge tour.   2000 was a bad beat, with the best offence of all time up to that point losing to a very complete Giants team, although young Daunte looked like a rookie in that one, old Carter looked like he was done and they just tilted everything to shut down Moss.  1998 was an upset, but running into the #2 defence in the conference on a huge hot streak isn't completely shameful.  1987 they got past the Niners but faced a defensive juggernaut in that Redskins team that was one of Gibbs' better teams.  The Vikings have usually been very capable, but they've also been very inconsistent since Denny Green left town.  It's not like any of those losses are bizarre outliers.  

As for the Falcons, they've had tons of offensive talent, but their reliably questionable defence and bad coaching has tended to hurt them.  They've been to the Superbowl twice, and both times have lost to all-time greats."

This is the best way to guarantee that the winner of the coin flip gets as close to 50% win rate as possible. Any other method pushes that win rate from 52% up to around 58%. Angry fans go into it trying to judge by emotion after a loss saying each team should get a chance.

How many units played in this OT? Offense for the Vikings and defense for the Saints. And this wasn’t a weird situation either. Neither of their special teams got to play either unless you count a kickoff which has already been proven to be pretty much pointless. How many times have you seen only 1 offense and 1 defense play in college OT? Very rare as it’d require a pick 6."

Unitas is truly the greatest QB ever. Staubach was an outstanding QB against whom no lead was safe. Moon rounds out the top 10. Sammy Baugh and Otto Graham revolutionized the position of QB, as did Unitas. Before Graham and Unitas, you ran the ball as your major form of offense and passed out of desperation. After them (esp. Unitas), the passing game took a much more prominent role. 

Favre took almost every all-time record at the time and smashed it. 

>He has the highest career completion percentage and 5 of the top 6 single season percentages.

In an era where you can't mug WRs like you could even 20 years ago. Completion percentages league wide are up. In 2003, the Colts led the league with a 63% completion percentage. That would've placed them 16th this year, just ahead of the LA Rams."

[NFL 52.7%, CFB 54.9%](https://mobile.twitter.com/rosstuckernfl/status/1087751408928153600) Counting ties as half a win makes the team who elects to receive win 53% of the time.

How many sports do you know where someone breaks a record, then sets the bar over 10% higher?

There are other rules that can ALSO get near 50/50 that is fair to both teams. Overall it may look balanced but each individual game is heavily influenced by the toss.

It's only when a team scores a TD on the first drive that this isn't possible. If the only change is that both teams are guaranteed to get at least one possession, I don't see how this significantly changes anything if the team who scores first can just get the ball back and score again while the 2nd team doesn't get another chance. All that's going to do is make OT's even longer.

Looking at stats alone doesn't tell the full truth, but ignoring them  is equally stupid. The main reason people don't like the current rule is because their emotions get in the way of looking at it analytically. 

And yeah comparing it to basketball makes zero sense, in each basketball OT both teams are guaranteed to get like 10+ possessions.

There was an interesting rule proposal drafted by some guy a few years ago that involved auctioning field position and giving the ball to the team that elected to take the ball furthest from the end zone. This essentially allows both teams to evaluate their strengths and make a decision without a coin flip influencing the outcome. But I don't see the NFL ever implementing something that convoluted.
