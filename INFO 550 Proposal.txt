1. How does playcalling per down/distance from the endzone change from preseason to postseason? Over the years and by team?
	- https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data/tree/master/play_by_play_data
	- look at reasonable access (game time, etc.) to figure out distribution of playtypes, look at specific situation
	- generic -> specific story
	- potentially show rudimentary apps, show progression of working with data from start, tell a story
		- explain issues with analysis/deployment
			- potentially putting data into a database/etc.
	- what happened, what didn't happen, what were the challenges? 
		- code that I tried, etc. 
		- here's what I came up with



Probability of positive EPA at each yard line per play type
	- use ggplotly instead of plotly
	



2. In the post-season, what is the most effective playcall for each down and distance (non-redzone plays)?

Both of these in a Shiny webapp or something similar so that they're deployable/shareable

3. Scrape Twitter and/or Reddit (game threads) and look at sentiment analysis after risky plays? Not sure how I would quantify risky yet, maybe something like postseason 4th down plays where the play isn't a kick?

	- fantasy football forum, ask a question
		- what kinds of information would you like to know?
